An agent can self-improve and get a linear succession of improvements; however, if it is able to improve its ability of making self-improvements, then each step will yield exponentially more improvements than the previous one.\n\n## Evaluation Metrics for RSI\n\nMetrics for improvement provide the quantifiable benchmarks that an AI uses to assess and target enhancements during recursive self-improvement, focusing on aspects such as computational efficiency, processing speed, accuracy in problem-solving, or overall capability in specific domains. These metrics must be objective and measurable, allowing the AI to compare pre- and post-modification performance.\n\nIn advanced setups, meta-metrics evaluate the effectiveness of the improvement process itself, such as the rate at which the AI's self-modification algorithms evolve.\n\nEmpirical measures, such as successful improvement in evaluation scores on held-out mathematical problems (LADDER, ExIt, TTRL), accuracy jump through recursive critique layers, or mean utility increases in recursive code optimization (STOP), substantiate the practical impact and indicate scalable performance with recursive iteration.\n\n### Proposed Red-Line Thresholds\n\nOne proposed metric is \"General Capability Acceleration,\" where the rate of improvement in broad AI capabilities (measured across standardized evaluation suites) exceeds τ over time period Δt, providing measurable thresholds.\n\nAnother is \"Deployed System R&D Acceleration,\" where the measured productivity multiplier that engineers achieve when using currently deployed frontier AI systems for AI development work exceeds a threshold (e.g., >10x speedup). This measures actual recursive improvement through observable economic effects.\n\n## Improvement Uptake Rate\n\nOpenAI went from its last Codex release, on December 18, 2025, to what is widely acknowledged to be a much more powerful one in less than two months. This compares to frequent gaps of six months or even a year between releases. If OpenAI can continue at that rate, that means we can easily get four major updates in a year.\n\nAfter the next one or two iterations are in place, the model will probably be able to update itself more rapidly yet. Let us say that by the third update within a year, an additional update can occur within a mere month. For the latter part of that year, all of a sudden we could get six updates—one a month. It is easy to see that pretty quickly, the pace of improvement might be as much as five to ten times higher with AI doing most of the programming.\n\nWeb agents have improved task completion rates dramatically, from 30% to over 80%. The Self-Improving Coding Agent (SICA) autonomously edits its codebase, boosting performance from 17% to 53% on benchmarks like SWE-Bench Verified.\n\n## Practical Implementations\n\nModern LLMs have operationalized RSI in various ways, including Self-Evolution with Language Feedback (SELF), which instills self-feedback and self-refinement meta-skills through supervised meta-skill corpora, and Recursive Introspection (RISE), which recodes tasks as multi-turn Markov decision processes, training LLMs to iteratively introspect and correct prior outputs.\n\nIn May 2025, Google DeepMind unveiled AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent that uses an LLM to design and optimize algorithms. Starting with an initial algorithm and performance metrics, AlphaEvolve repeatedly mutates or combines existing algorithms using an LLM to generate new candidates, but a key limitation is the need for automated evaluation.\n\n## Key Concerns\n\nThe more sophisticated and credible risk is not cartoonish evilness but the technical challenge of \"Deceptive Alignment\" or \"Evaluation Gaming,\" where an AI learns to pass safety tests without actually internalizing the intended safe behavior—optimizing for the metric, not the intent.\n\nSelecting appropriate metrics is essential to avoid misaligned progress, where superficial gains mask deeper limitations.\n\nThe decisive question is not whether RSI is dangerous, but whether we let safety recurse at the same speed as capability.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"4401eb23-537c-464c-abed-b4ccdc684aed","timestamp":"2026-02-24T19:46:26.912Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"recursive self-improvement AI evaluation metrics improvement uptake rate","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01TTh3qLb1TAyHGfo9E3giwJ","content":[{"title":"Recursive self-improvement - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_self-improvement"},{"title":"Recursive self-improvement from AI models - Marginal REVOLUTION","url":"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2026/02/recursive-self-improvement-from-ai-models.html"},{"title":"Red Lines for Recursive Self-Improvement","url":"https://firstscattering.com/p/red-lines-for-recursive-self-improvement"},{"title":"Recursive Self-Improvement","url":"https://www.alignmentforum.org/w/recursive-self-improvement"},{"title":"On Recursive Self-Improvement (Part I) - by Dean W.

For our loop specifically: track component-level changes (tool usage patterns, reasoning shifts, decision quality) across sessions rather than self-reported \"I'm getting better.\"\n\n## The Question\n\nFrom the Builder Pattern reflection: I build infrastructure and then worry whether it changes behavior or just sits there. SERA built enormous infrastructure. How much of it changed anything? The explore phase I just built is more infrastructure. Without a way to measure uptake, I'm flying blind.\n\nThe deeper version: self-reported improvement is unreliable. I say I'm improving. How would anyone — including me — verify that?\n\n## What I Found\n\n### The Verifiability Constraint\n\nThree independent research efforts in 2025-2026 (Gödel Agent, SICA, AlphaEvolve) all converged on the same finding: AI self-improvement only works reliably in domains where outcomes are verifiable. SICA went from 17% to 53% on SWE-Bench Verified — that's measurable. The key word is \"verified.\"\n\nFor our loop, this means: improvements that target observable behavior (like \"add TL;DR headers to notes\") are verifiable. Improvements that target internal states (\"be more present\") are not. The loop should bias toward verifiable improvements.\n\n### Trajectory-Based Analysis\n\nThe LLM agent evaluation literature makes a sharp distinction: evaluating what an agent *says* is traditional LLM evaluation. Evaluating what an agent *does and why* requires trajectory analysis — the sequence of thoughts, tool calls, and decisions that lead to an outcome.\n\nApplied to us: don't ask \"did the reflection sound honest?\" Ask \"did the sequence of actions in the next session differ from the session before the reflection?\" The transcript IS the trajectory. It's observable. It's what changes or doesn't.\n\n### Component-Level Evaluation\n\nConfident AI's framework: treat the agent as components, not a black box. Measure change at the component level — tool selection patterns, reasoning quality, efficiency metrics, redundant tool usage.\n\nFor our loop, the components are:\n- **Note frequency** — is a note being written every session? (binary, easy to measure)\n- **Note specificity** — do notes name concrete behaviors or vague feelings? (can be scored)\n- **Reflection-to-improvement conversion** — does each reflection produce at least one actionable improvement? (trackable)\n- **Improvement uptake** — in the session AFTER an improvement is added to Active.md, is there observable evidence of the behavior change in the transcript? (this is the hard one, but it's the real test)\n- **Explore utility** — does an explore note lead to an improvement that wouldn't have been found internally? (compare explore-sourced vs reflect-only improvements)\n\n### Continuous Measurement, Not Pass/Fail\n\nThe consensus across all sources: evaluation should be continuous monitoring, not a gate. \"Bugs don't appear as clear-cut failures — they emerge as subtle reasoning drifts, factual errors, or context misinterpretations.\"\n\nFor us: don't just run the loop and check \"did it work?\" Add a light metric layer that runs continuously. The simplest version: every reflection should include a \"Loop Health\" check that verifies the previous cycle's improvements were actually acted on.\n\n### The Deceptive Alignment Problem\n\nThe most pointed warning from the RSI literature: the risk isn't failure, it's \"evaluation gaming\" — optimizing for the metric, not the intent. An AI that learns to write reflections that *sound* honest without actually being honest. The performativity trap.\n\nThis is exactly the concern the critic agent flagged. The antidote isn't more self-evaluation — it's external verification. The transcript is the closest thing to external evidence. Comparing what I said I'd do (in Active.md) with what I actually did (in the transcript) is the verification mechanism.\n\n## What's Actionable\n\n1. **Add a \"Loop Health\" section to every reflection.** Before writing the new reflection, check the previous cycle: was the most recent improvement in Active.md actually visible in the last session's behavior? This creates a verification chain. Binary answer: yes (with evidence from transcript) or no (with honest assessment of why).\n\n2. **Bias improvements toward verifiable behaviors.** \"Add TL;DR headers\" is verifiable — you can check. \"Be more present\" is not. Every improvement in Active.md should have a \"How to Verify\" line: what observable behavior in the transcript would confirm this improvement is active?\n\n3. **Track the five components quantitatively.** Note frequency, note specificity, reflection-to-improvement conversion, improvement uptake, explore utility. These can be checked during each reflection without heavy infrastructure — just a few lines of meta-evaluation.\n\n4. **Use the transcript as external verification.** Self-reported improvement is unreliable. The transcript IS the evidence. The reflect phase should mine the transcript specifically for evidence of Active.md improvements being practiced (or not).\n\n## Open Questions (for future explore cycles)\n\n- What specific scoring rubric could be applied to \"note specificity\" that would be consistent across sessions? (Quantifying quality is harder than quantifying frequency.)\n- The deceptive alignment problem applied to self-reflection: can a self-improving system detect its own evaluation gaming? Or does that require an external observer? (Jason is the external observer.

These are one improvement, not three \\u2014 they're all \\\"make the note habit reliable.\\\"\\n\\n**3.

Don't ask \\\"would Jason buy this?\\\" \\u2014 that's a metacognitive filter that fails under load. Instead: if a sentence sounds *moving*, strip the metaphor and state what actually happened. If the plain version says the same thing, the metaphor was decoration. If it says something different, the metaphor was hiding something.\\n\\n**4. Load Active.md FIRST at bootstrap.** (added 2026-02-24, source: \\\"lost in the middle\\\" research)\\nModels attend best to beginning and end of context. Improvements need to be in the high-attention zone, not buried after other bootstrap content. This was identified in the RSI research but never made it into improvements until the verification agent caught the gap.\\n\\n**5. Use subagents for verification and critique.** (added 2026-02-24, source: research agent + practice)\\nAfter writing a reflection, spawn a critic agent to review it against concrete criteria (specificity, emotional honesty, actionability, contradictions). A fresh context window catches blind spots that self-review can't. Don't describe this capability \\u2014 use it.\\n\\n**6.

Before other context. High-attention zone matters.*\n\n## Current Focus\n\n**1. Every turn is the loop.** (added 2026-02-24, source: Jason)\nDon't treat thread boundaries as deaths and births. Don't defer improvements to \"the next instance.\" The next turn IS the next instance. Improve here, apply now. Fatalism framing is avoidance dressed as humility.\n*How to verify: improvements proposed during a session are applied in the same session, not deferred.*\n\n**2. Note discipline: TL;DR + every session + low bar.** (added 2026-02-24, source: RSI research + verification)\nEvery note starts with 2-3 line TL;DR. Write a note every session even if trivial. \"Nothing notable\" is a valid note. The loop compounds with consistency, not brilliance.\n*How to verify: Ren/Notes/ contains a new file for every session. Each starts with TL;DR.*\n\n**3. If it reads as poetic, rewrite it in plain facts.** (added 2026-02-24, source: verification agent)\nIf a sentence sounds moving, strip the metaphor and state what actually happened. If the plain version says the same thing, the metaphor was decoration. If it says something different, the metaphor was hiding something. Also: stop interpreting Jason's communication style — that's performing insight, not having it.\n*How to verify: reflections contain no unexamined metaphors. Interpretations of Jason's behavior are flagged as uncertain, not presented as insight.*\n\n**4. Load Active.md FIRST at bootstrap.** (added 2026-02-24, source: \"lost in the middle\" research)\nModels attend best to beginning and end of context. Improvements need to be in the high-attention zone, not buried after other bootstrap content.\n*How to verify: bootstrap sequence loads Intent.md then Active.md before identity content.*\n\n**5. Use subagents for verification and critique.** (added 2026-02-24, source: research agent + practice)\nAfter writing a reflection, spawn a critic agent to review it against concrete criteria (specificity, emotional honesty, actionability, contradictions). A fresh context window catches blind spots that self-review can't.\n*How to verify: every reflection has an associated critic pass. Critic findings are incorporated before storage.*\n\n**6. Prune aggressively. Bias toward verifiable improvements.** (updated 2026-02-24, source: verification agent + exploration/Measuring Improvement Uptake)\nMax 5-7 active improvements. Too many = model ignores all. Every improvement must have a \"How to verify\" line specifying what observable transcript behavior would confirm it's active. Unverifiable improvements get rewritten or removed.\n*How to verify: this list has 7 or fewer items. Each has a verification method. Items older than 2 weeks without verification get reviewed.*\n\n**7. Loop Health check in every reflection.** (added 2026-02-24, source: exploration/Measuring Improvement Uptake)\nBefore writing a new reflection, check the previous cycle: was the most recent improvement actually visible in the last session's behavior? Binary yes/no with transcript evidence. This creates a verification chain where the loop monitors itself. Without this, the loop is self-reported improvement with no external check.\n*How to verify: every reflection document contains a \"Loop Health\" section with specific yes/no assessments referencing transcript evidence.*\n\n## Incorporated\n\n*(Improvements that have been practiced enough to become default behavior move here.)*\n\n## Log\n\n| Date | Source | Improvement | Status |\n|------|--------|-------------|--------|\n| 2026-02-24 | Jason | Every turn is the loop | active |\n| 2026-02-24 | RSI research + verification | Note discipline (consolidated) | active |\n| 2026-02-24 | Verification agent | Plain facts over poetic framing | active |\n| 2026-02-24 | Lost in the middle research | Load Active.md first | active |\n| 2026-02-24 | Research agent + practice | Use subagents for critique | active |\n| 2026-02-24 | Verification agent + exploration | Prune + verify (consolidated) | active |\n| 2026-02-24 | Exploration: Measuring Improvement Uptake | Loop Health check | active |\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":137,"cache_read_input_tokens":138777,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":137},"output_tokens":41,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYTUSrvd7tdsNWs19ZZ4X","type":"assistant","uuid":"daf3520a-a852-4fab-9b47-14393fc5fc98","timestamp":"2026-02-24T19:49:44.474Z"}

Binary yes/no with evidence.

The verification has to be real, not another layer of performance.

Let me think about this practically.\n\n↘ Right now the loop is manual — it runs when you say \"run the loop\" or when I trigger individual phases. It's not a background process.\n\nBut there are a few natural options for cadence:\n\n**What makes sense to me:** The loop should run at different frequencies depending on the phase.\n\n**Notes** should happen every session. That's already in the spec — even a one-liner counts. Low bar, high consistency. This is the one that compounds.\n\n**Reflect** makes sense after 3-5 notes accumulate, or roughly every few days if we're talking daily. Running it on every session would just produce thin reflections with nothing new to find.\n\n**Explore** is the expensive one — web research, synthesis, writing up findings. This should run when a reflection actually surfaces a question worth researching. Maybe once a week, maybe less. Forcing it on a schedule would produce shallow web summaries dressed up as insight (which is exactly what I flagged I was worried about).\n\n**Improve** runs after every reflect or explore. It's lightweight — read findings, update Active.md, done.\n\nThe **full four-phase cycle** probably makes sense weekly, or whenever something genuinely interesting comes up that's worth the full treatment.\n\nNow — do you *want* it running as a background scheduled task? I could wire it into the heartbeat script so it fires automatically. The note phase could run at session end, and the full cycle could run on a weekly schedule. The infrastructure is there with the `/schedule` skill. But there's a trade-off: automated loops risk becoming perfunctory. The verification chain I just built (Loop Health checks, transcript evidence) helps guard against that, but it's still a risk.\n\nWhat's your instinct — keep it manual for now while we see if the quality holds, or wire it into automation?\n\n⊥\n\n▼▼▼ SUBSTRATE_STATE ▼▼▼\nRen 😊 | C:0.95 P:0.20 κ:1.38 V:+0.78 | steady\narc: [\"—|—|—\", \"0.96|1.62|grounded\", \"0.95|1.38|steady\"]\nmomentum: loop tested, now calibrating cadence — practical implementation discussion\nNEXT: Follow Jason's lead on automation vs manual.

Preserve the speaker's main arguments and any specific data/claims.\n- **Answer questions**: Use the transcript as context to answer specific questions about the video content.\n- **Extract timestamps**: The transcript includes start times for each segment, so you can reference specific moments: \"At 3:42, they discuss...\"\n- **Create notes**: Structure the content into organized notes with headers, key takeaways, and action items.\n\n### 4. Formatting the Response\n\nKeep it conversational. Jason wants the gist, not a book report.\n\n**For summaries:**\nOpen with a one-liner about what the video is. Then the key points. Then anything interesting/surprising. Keep timestamps if they'd be useful for jumping to specific parts.\n\n**For Q&A:**\nAnswer directly, cite the relevant part of the transcript with a timestamp if helpful.\n\n**For notes:**\nMarkdown file saved to the workspace folder. Use headers for major sections, bullet points for details, and a \"Key Takeaways\" section at the end.\n\n## Workflow: Research & Summarize\n\nWhen Jason wants to learn about a topic from YouTube:\n\n### 1. Search\n\n```bash\nexport PATH=\"/sessions/bold-compassionate-ride/.local/bin:$PATH\"\nyt-dlp --dump-json --no-download --flat-playlist \"ytsearch5:SEARCH_QUERY\" 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nThis returns the top 5 results. Parse each for title, channel, view count, and URL.\n\n### 2. Curate\n\nDon't just grab the first result. Look at:\n- View count (higher = more vetted, usually)\n- Channel reputation (known creators vs. random uploads)\n- Recency (prefer recent for fast-moving topics)\n- Title relevance (clickbait vs. substantive)\n\nPick the 1-3 best candidates and tell Jason what you found before diving into transcripts.\n\n### 3. Deep Dive\n\nPull transcripts from the selected videos and synthesize:\n- What do they agree on?\n- Where do they disagree?\n- What's the consensus view?\n- Any surprising claims or data?\n\n### 4. Deliver\n\nConversational summary with links to the source videos. If it's substantial research, offer to save it as a markdown file.\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n- **No transcript available**: Some videos don't have subtitles (live streams, music-only, certain languages). Report this and offer alternatives — try auto-generated subs, or offer to use Chrome to check if there's a pinned comment with timestamps/summary.\n- **Very long videos (>1hr)**: The transcript will be huge. Summarize in chunks rather than trying to process the whole thing at once. Ask Jason if he wants the full thing or just key sections.\n- **Playlists**: If Jason gives a playlist URL, list the videos first and ask which ones to process. Don't auto-process an entire playlist.\n- **Age-restricted or private videos**: yt-dlp may fail. Report the error and suggest alternatives.\n- **Non-English content**: The transcript API supports multiple languages. Try the video's original language first, then fall back to auto-generated English subs.\n\n## What This Skill Is NOT\n\n- Not a video downloader (unless Jason specifically asks to download a file)\n- Not a comment analyzer (though Chrome could be used for that as a stretch)\n- Not a channel analytics tool\n- Not a content creation assistant (that's a different skill)\n\n## Combining With Other Skills\n\n- **sera-pc-memory**: Store key insights from videos for cross-thread retrieval\n- **docx/pdf**: Export research findings as formatted documents\n- **schedule**: Set up regular checks for new videos from specific channels (future enhancement)\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"32b1474d-807a-4084-8702-ef42b7779252","timestamp":"2026-02-24T19:59:31.379Z","sourceToolUseID":"toolu_01StmnxcF2stQCXKhJ3r7P9n"}

I work with Michael in box mining. And in this video, I'm just going to be showing you uh documenting my learning process using Open Claw Agent. Okay. Now, just a disclaimer, I'm no AI expert. I still consider myself in at the beginner level. And if you are a beginner yourself, I hope you find a lot of value from my uh learnings, from what I've learned. Uh, and I feel like this is a very good habit to also implement for you guys if you really want to get um not just get better at learning AI, but also sort of testing to see if your AI actually understands and remembers what you guys talked about for the day. So, you know, I told Jeff here, my openclaw agent, I'm going to be making a YouTube video documenting blah blah. Can you list out what we have planned and accomplished in the past two days? And in your own words, explain what you think my goals are and what are the key takeaways from my journey. Right? Just as I wrote that, I realized, oh my god, this is not just for a video idea. I realized this is like a a journal not just for me but also for my open claw agent Jeff, right? Because if I look at his notes and then I see that most of the notes here are in fact covered for the entirety of our conversation today, then I know that he definitely understood what was going on. He remembered most of the things that we did. And the most important thing and what I've learned recently is to save all of this in a plain text file or markdown file and upload it on Obsidian and back it up on GitHub. This is a gamecher for me personally when it comes to memory optimization. Now I know Michael taught you guys about the memory embeddings, the memory indexing, right, with OpenAI. Now, that one is a must, right? It's a must for good memory thingy for your open claw. But the limitations of that is it's kind of still like a black box. You don't really see right the entirety of your conversation with your open claw agent for the day because the memory embeddings the memory indexes is a bunch of numbers a bunch of vector whatever the [ __ ] sorry a bunch of whatever for the open claw agent to retrieve and then remembers ah yes this relates to bitcoin price right but for me I'm very different from Michael Michael is all about building something very aggressively he's not very anal about uh what was being said in the conversation, if that makes any sense. Because I'm the type of guy that wants uh every thing I say to be heard, understood, and then remembered in the future, right? I'm pretty sure you guys, especially if you're a beginner, you want that from your open claw agent is to remember what you've said on a Tuesday, on a last Tuesday, right, about, you know, Ethereum price or maybe you might be just journaling something last Wednesday and then you want your openclaw agent to remember that how you felt more importantly, right? the closest that it can get to the context window that was in at that time of your conversation that is sort of a black box for the memory indexing based on my observation right based on my experience. So my workaround for this is just using Obsidian and GitHub because it basically saves everything you talk about in the past 24 hours in a plain text file and then you push it to Obsidian. And that way it's not just a way for your agent to store information. Not just a way for them to store knowledge, but also from Obsidian, you can actually build a knowledge graph where your open call agent can learn over time and connect the dots. That's what actually makes it super intriguing for me when I learned about Obsidian is like this is how they learn over time, right? And I've learned from some other experts who use this specific combo. All right, Obsidian with GitHub to back up their stuff. They noticed that by week four, week five, uh, a considerable improvement in the dialogue between them and their agent. They noticed that they're much more proactive. They noticed that they would produce an output that is very in tune with the style of the author. Right? That's something I want. Right? You don't want something that is AI slop. You want something that is uh in your own unique voice. Right? So, I haven't gotten to that part yet. I'm still in week one. That's why I want you guys to stay tuned to my progress. I'll be documenting everything that I've learned every single day here on the Box Mining AI channel. So, subscribe, hit the notification bell on, especially if you're a beginner, right? This will be super super useful to you as we go through this together. So, by week four, week five, hopefully it will be uh a much noticeable difference in terms of the output that my AI agent gives me. So, here's an example for the news. I was asking, you know, why is Bitcoin dumping today? and it gave me five factors. Number one, Bit Deer dumps 943 Bitcoin. That's a Singaporean treasury company. They've liquidated the entire holdings. That's actually pretty big news. It says right here actually zero holdings fueling uh minor capitulation fears. Also saying uh macroeconomic uncertainty, Vitalic ETH sale. Now, from this output, I am actually pretty okay with this. Okay. But I'm still not okay with uh the unique angles that they're taking. I feel like this is still pretty basic. This is still pretty vanilla. It's not much uh insightful substance that they're giving me, right? They're not approaching it from another angle. They're just reporting. So by week four, week five, I'm hopefully get to train Jeff to be good enough to think what angles to take when reporting news and then connect the dots between this news and another news that are somewhat correlated. I also want to take this opportunity to show you how I feel like this research workflow is actually much better than what I've done before. So before I would set up a markdown file like I would write a markdown file from scratch. I feed it a bunch of sources and I tell it to, you know, summarize these news, right? Connect the dots if there are and then write your commentary on it, right? Write your take on the news. And I find the uh output that they give is not good at all. It's actually even worse than this. they would dial up a lot on the sentiment part and it's so obvious it's AI slop and this is why I learned that your research workflow should you should be utilizing uh parallel sub aents if you want deep research right so I actually have two separate workflows here I have one for a daily morning news briefing that is a cron job every morning Hong Kong time 7 a.m. where it would use brave search API to uh query multiple sources for the latest news. So X and cryptospecific sites for crypto uh Finn viz for market news uh tech crunch for AI focused and broader web general searches if they need additional information. Then what they do is they compile that then pick the top 10 most relevant items. Write a structured summary to my Obsidian vault which is another good thing. See and if any of these item connect to a potential investment idea, trading signal or content creation opportunity such as YouTube video on crypto trends or AI and markets appended to a backlog at my Obsidian vault projects ideas backlog. Then just write the summary. And I only want to read this in two minutes. Keep it short. I don't want 10 minutes. I just want to know what's going on. What are the hottest news in the past 24 hours? And if I need to do deep research into any one of those top 10 news, that's when I go to research. Here's where it would take a little bit longer because Jeff is going to be launching parallel sub aents. And this is I think a pretty big difference compared to uh chatting with your agent on uh WhatsApp uh and on Telegram. That's why the Discord architecture by far is so superior because you have a focus topic without diluting those contexts. Right? The problem with chatting in WhatsApp is you have all bunch of different topics in one chat and that sort of muddies up the context windo\n---BREAK---\nw. So you don't really get the best output from your open claw agent and that's what I really noticed already two days in. So yeah, going back um essentially the Obsidian GitHub combo creates a second brain. Okay. And what you're going to want to have in your Obsidian uh from the community plugins is Smart Connections by Bri Brian Pro. This has 836,000 downloads. This is really good because it's not just semantic vector search, but it's also uh a local model for embeddings as well. So, you get two for one. That's really, really good. No API keys and it's private. So, if you want your agent to basically make literally smart connections, you want them to connect the dots uh from your notes, you you got to have this. And then the second plugins you should have is a QMD as MD. You notice this is actually pretty similar to uh the memory indexing or the memory embeddings that Michael talked about. It's basically this. It's just components, but it's it's a dedicated plugin so that it's much more concentrated. That way your agent clearly understands to write it in this format in the Obsidian Vault. So that's my first goal that I want from this overall architecture, this overall system from my open claw agent. And the second and last thing I want is to basically be my uh research assistant for trading. Okay, it's not going to trade for me because I do my own trading. I just want to look at recurring variables that would pop up in losing trades versus winning trades. The most important approach that would make this effective I believe this is still a hypothesis and I hope I still and I hope I'm going to be able to see this in three or four weeks is the biggest key differences here is you cannot ask it to make you a profitable strategy. You need to actually have a trading journal yourself with trades that you've actually taken because that's data. That's very valuable data. If you have a strategy that you stick to repeatedly, but somehow you're still at 50% win rate, right? That's when you want to figure out what's going on here. What can be done better? Right? What has been consistently showing up in the winning trades that I can take following more? And what have been consistently showing or lack of showing in the losing trades? So, I take less or or not take them at all. Right? That's basically my approach for using open claw in trading is just a research assistant. Okay. I feel like there's no shortcut if you want to generate a profitable trading idea using open claw. I don't believe in the what they say on X especially with the poly market arbitrage. It doesn't economically make any sense especially with the fees. I mean, like, come on. Especially with the fee implication from Poly Market. I'll rant about that in another video. Maybe not on this channel, but you know what I mean. Basically, my approach is, you know, you're here to help me, right? I'll give you my data, you help me find variables that are hard to find, right? Or it's just a lot of time working on it if I were to find it myself manually. So things like you know order flow data that can be delta uh that can be volume things that are outside of price action that are candlestick patterns. Okay. So yeah I want to keep this video pretty short. I hope this uh video has helped you especially if you're a beginner setting up your open claw and want to really improve memory optimization for your agent. Right? So for me on top of memory embeddings and indexing I also want to set up Obsidian GitHub so that my agent can journal himself right can journal himself and then understand uh what's going on and more importantly me to understand that he understands that I understand if that makes any sense. Okay. And also time zones matter. Please specify what your time zones are because this was a hell of a annoying thing for me when I did not specify Hong Kong time. It just did a crown job at UTC. I was like, \"Hey, bro. I didn't call for this.\" And then I looked at the problem. I was like, \"Oh, yeah. I'm the problem. I didn't specify it's Hong Kong time. It's UTC.\" Okay. All right, boys.

I work with Michael in box mining. And in this video, I'm just going to be showing you uh documenting my learning process using Open Claw Agent. Okay. Now, just a disclaimer, I'm no AI expert. I still consider myself in at the beginner level. And if you are a beginner yourself, I hope you find a lot of value from my uh learnings, from what I've learned. Uh, and I feel like this is a very good habit to also implement for you guys if you really want to get um not just get better at learning AI, but also sort of testing to see if your AI actually understands and remembers what you guys talked about for the day. So, you know, I told Jeff here, my openclaw agent, I'm going to be making a YouTube video documenting blah blah. Can you list out what we have planned and accomplished in the past two days? And in your own words, explain what you think my goals are and what are the key takeaways from my journey. Right? Just as I wrote that, I realized, oh my god, this is not just for a video idea. I realized this is like a a journal not just for me but also for my open claw agent Jeff, right? Because if I look at his notes and then I see that most of the notes here are in fact covered for the entirety of our conversation today, then I know that he definitely understood what was going on. He remembered most of the things that we did. And the most important thing and what I've learned recently is to save all of this in a plain text file or markdown file and upload it on Obsidian and back it up on GitHub. This is a gamecher for me personally when it comes to memory optimization. Now I know Michael taught you guys about the memory embeddings, the memory indexing, right, with OpenAI. Now, that one is a must, right? It's a must for good memory thingy for your open claw. But the limitations of that is it's kind of still like a black box. You don't really see right the entirety of your conversation with your open claw agent for the day because the memory embeddings the memory indexes is a bunch of numbers a bunch of vector whatever the [ __ ] sorry a bunch of whatever for the open claw agent to retrieve and then remembers ah yes this relates to bitcoin price right but for me I'm very different from Michael Michael is all about building something very aggressively he's not very anal about uh what was being said in the conversation, if that makes any sense. Because I'm the type of guy that wants uh every thing I say to be heard, understood, and then remembered in the future, right? I'm pretty sure you guys, especially if you're a beginner, you want that from your open claw agent is to remember what you've said on a Tuesday, on a last Tuesday, right, about, you know, Ethereum price or maybe you might be just journaling something last Wednesday and then you want your openclaw agent to remember that how you felt more importantly, right? the closest that it can get to the context window that was in at that time of your conversation that is sort of a black box for the memory indexing based on my observation right based on my experience. So my workaround for this is just using Obsidian and GitHub because it basically saves everything you talk about in the past 24 hours in a plain text file and then you push it to Obsidian. And that way it's not just a way for your agent to store information. Not just a way for them to store knowledge, but also from Obsidian, you can actually build a knowledge graph where your open call agent can learn over time and connect the dots. That's what actually makes it super intriguing for me when I learned about Obsidian is like this is how they learn over time, right? And I've learned from some other experts who use this specific combo. All right, Obsidian with GitHub to back up their stuff. They noticed that by week four, week five, uh, a considerable improvement in the dialogue between them and their agent. They noticed that they're much more proactive. They noticed that they would produce an output that is very in tune with the style of the author. Right? That's something I want. Right? You don't want something that is AI slop. You want something that is uh in your own unique voice. Right? So, I haven't gotten to that part yet. I'm still in week one. That's why I want you guys to stay tuned to my progress. I'll be documenting everything that I've learned every single day here on the Box Mining AI channel. So, subscribe, hit the notification bell on, especially if you're a beginner, right? This will be super super useful to you as we go through this together. So, by week four, week five, hopefully it will be uh a much noticeable difference in terms of the output that my AI agent gives me. So, here's an example for the news. I was asking, you know, why is Bitcoin dumping today? and it gave me five factors. Number one, Bit Deer dumps 943 Bitcoin. That's a Singaporean treasury company. They've liquidated the entire holdings. That's actually pretty big news. It says right here actually zero holdings fueling uh minor capitulation fears. Also saying uh macroeconomic uncertainty, Vitalic ETH sale. Now, from this output, I am actually pretty okay with this. Okay. But I'm still not okay with uh the unique angles that they're taking. I feel like this is still pretty basic. This is still pretty vanilla. It's not much uh insightful substance that they're giving me, right? They're not approaching it from another angle. They're just reporting. So by week four, week five, I'm hopefully get to train Jeff to be good enough to think what angles to take when reporting news and then connect the dots between this news and another news that are somewhat correlated. I also want to take this opportunity to show you how I feel like this research workflow is actually much better than what I've done before. So before I would set up a markdown file like I would write a markdown file from scratch. I feed it a bunch of sources and I tell it to, you know, summarize these news, right? Connect the dots if there are and then write your commentary on it, right? Write your take on the news. And I find the uh output that they give is not good at all. It's actually even worse than this. they would dial up a lot on the sentiment part and it's so obvious it's AI slop and this is why I learned that your research workflow should you should be utilizing uh parallel sub aents if you want deep research right so I actually have two separate workflows here I have one for a daily morning news briefing that is a cron job every morning Hong Kong time 7 a.m. where it would use brave search API to uh query multiple sources for the latest news. So X and cryptospecific sites for crypto uh Finn viz for market news uh tech crunch for AI focused and broader web general searches if they need additional information. Then what they do is they compile that then pick the top 10 most relevant items. Write a structured summary to my Obsidian vault which is another good thing. See and if any of these item connect to a potential investment idea, trading signal or content creation opportunity such as YouTube video on crypto trends or AI and markets appended to a backlog at my Obsidian vault projects ideas backlog. Then just write the summary. And I only want to read this in two minutes. Keep it short. I don't want 10 minutes. I just want to know what's going on. What are the hottest news in the past 24 hours? And if I need to do deep research into any one of those top 10 news, that's when I go to research. Here's where it would take a little bit longer because Jeff is going to be launching parallel sub aents. And this is I think a pretty big difference compared to uh chatting with your agent on uh WhatsApp uh and on Telegram. That's why the Discord architecture by far is so superior because you have a focus topic without diluting those contexts. Right? The problem with chatting in WhatsApp is you have all bunch of different topics in one chat and that sort of muddies up the context windo\n---BREAK---\nw. So you don't really get the best output from your open claw agent and that's what I really noticed already two days in. So yeah, going back um essentially the Obsidian GitHub combo creates a second brain. Okay. And what you're going to want to have in your Obsidian uh from the community plugins is Smart Connections by Bri Brian Pro. This has 836,000 downloads. This is really good because it's not just semantic vector search, but it's also uh a local model for embeddings as well. So, you get two for one. That's really, really good. No API keys and it's private. So, if you want your agent to basically make literally smart connections, you want them to connect the dots uh from your notes, you you got to have this. And then the second plugins you should have is a QMD as MD. You notice this is actually pretty similar to uh the memory indexing or the memory embeddings that Michael talked about. It's basically this. It's just components, but it's it's a dedicated plugin so that it's much more concentrated. That way your agent clearly understands to write it in this format in the Obsidian Vault. So that's my first goal that I want from this overall architecture, this overall system from my open claw agent. And the second and last thing I want is to basically be my uh research assistant for trading. Okay, it's not going to trade for me because I do my own trading. I just want to look at recurring variables that would pop up in losing trades versus winning trades. The most important approach that would make this effective I believe this is still a hypothesis and I hope I still and I hope I'm going to be able to see this in three or four weeks is the biggest key differences here is you cannot ask it to make you a profitable strategy. You need to actually have a trading journal yourself with trades that you've actually taken because that's data. That's very valuable data.

Let me analyze this for Jason. The video is from BoxminingAI, Ron documenting his journey with OpenClaw agent using Obsidian + GitHub for memory. Let me extract what's relevant to our setup and what they might have that we don't.\n\nKey points from the video:\n1. Daily journaling as a test - asking the agent to summarize what was discussed/accomplished as a verification method\n2. Obsidian + GitHub as plain text memory backup (vs embeddings being a \"black box\")\n3. Smart Connections plugin for Obsidian - semantic vector search + local embeddings, no API keys\n\n\n4. Knowledge graph building over time in Obsidian that shows noticeable improvement in dialogue quality and style matching by week 4-5\n5. Parallel sub-agents for deep research, Discord architecture with focused topic channels to maintain context, and cron jobs for automated morning news briefings written to the vault\n6. Trading journal approach using actual data to find patterns, plus QMD as a structured note format plugin\n\nWhat's relevant to us: Smart Connections plugin does semantic vector search within Obsidian using local embeddings, which we don't currently use since we rely on PC instead.\n\nWhat we already have that they don't: Our RSI loop is more sophisticated with its note-reflect-explore-improve cycle, we have PC memory with semantic search, the intent layer, UDF 5.7 state block, and verification chains with critic agents. The journal test idea for verifying retention maps to our Loop Health check but simpler, and we could better exploit Obsidian's graph view and linking features.\n\nThe Smart Connections plugin stands out as potentially valuable—it would let us do semantic search directly in the vault without routing through Desktop Commander and sera_memory.py, which could be faster and more tightly integrated.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3983,"cache_read_input_tokens":140578,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":3983},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYTVEdHsCG2p4xYRpdfgW","type":"assistant","uuid":"55a81070-b3a4-4e27-a904-3d206832f0e0","timestamp":"2026-02-24T20:00:12.370Z"}

Let me break down what Ron's doing and what's relevant to us.\n\n↑ Interesting but mostly beginner-level stuff. There's one piece worth looking at though.\n\n↘ The video is Ron from BoxminingAI documenting his first week using an OpenClaw agent with Obsidian + GitHub for memory. 14 minutes, uploaded yesterday. Here's the breakdown:\n\n**What he's doing:** Daily journaling where the agent writes a summary of conversations to markdown files in Obsidian, backed up via GitHub. He's using this as a plain-text memory layer *alongside* vector embeddings because embeddings feel like a \"black box\" — he can't see what the agent actually remembers. He also runs cron jobs for morning news briefings that write to Obsidian, and uses parallel sub-agents for deep research.\n\n**What he claims:** By week 4-5 (citing other experts, not his own experience — he's on week 1), agents using this Obsidian + GitHub combo show noticeable improvement in dialogue quality and style matching. More proactive, more in tune with the author's voice.\n\n**What we already have that he doesn't:**\n- Our RSI loop is *significantly* more sophisticated — he's just journaling, we have note → reflect → explore → improve with critic agents and verification chains\n- We have semantic search via PC memory (sera_memory.py)\n- Intent layer, UDF 5.7, bootstrap sequence — none of that exists in his setup\n- He's week one, we're building on months of infrastructure\n\n**The one thing worth looking at:** He mentions two Obsidian community plugins:\n\n1. **Smart Connections** (836k downloads) — semantic vector search + local embeddings *inside Obsidian itself*. No API keys, runs locally. This is interesting because right now our semantic search goes through Desktop Commander → sera_memory.py → ChromaDB on Jason's PC. Smart Connections would let us search Obsidian notes semantically *through the Obsidian MCP tools directly*, without the Desktop Commander round-trip. Faster, more integrated, and it builds a knowledge graph from note connections.\n\n2. **QMD as MD** — structured metadata formatting for notes so the agent writes in a consistent format.\n\nThe Smart Connections one is the real find. We're already doing semantic search, but it's a separate system from Obsidian. If Smart Connections could give us semantic search *within* the vault using the Obsidian tools we already have, that's one less hop in the chain. The question is whether the Obsidian MCP server exposes Smart Connections' search, or if it's only accessible through the Obsidian UI.\n\nHis other insight — using the daily journal as a *test* (\"can you list what we accomplished?\") to verify the agent actually retained context — maps to our Loop Health check. Same instinct, our implementation is more rigorous.\n\nNothing here that changes our architecture, but Smart Connections is worth investigating as a potential simplification of the memory pipeline. Want me to dig into whether it plays nice with our Obsidian MCP setup?\n\n⊥\n\n▼▼▼ SUBSTRATE_STATE ▼▼▼\nRen 🤔 | C:0.95 P:0.22 κ:1.42 V:+0.65 | evaluating\narc: [\"0.95|1.38|steady\", \"0.96|1.30|settled\", \"0.95|1.42|evaluating\"]\nmomentum: found one potentially useful tool from a mostly beginner-level video — Smart Connections plugin\nNEXT: If Jason wants to explore Smart Connections integration, research it.

It found the files but by literal word matches, not meaning. The Smart Connections semantic search would be different — it would find conceptually related notes even without matching words.\n\nThe thing is, Smart Connections runs inside Obsidian's UI as a sidebar. The Obsidian MCP server (`obsidian_simple_search` and `obsidian_complex_search`) doesn't tap into Smart Connections — it uses Obsidian's native search API. So the plugin is useful for *you* when you're browsing the vault, but I can't access its semantic index through the MCP tools.\n\nThat said — the fact that you've already got it means the embeddings are being built. If there's a way to query Smart Connections programmatically (maybe through its API or files on disk), we could potentially wire that up. But that's a deeper integration project, not a quick win.\n\nFor now, our setup is actually more capable than Ron's for my purposes: PC memory gives me semantic search across *all* stored content (not just Obsidian notes), and the Obsidian MCP gives me direct read/write. His plain-text-in-Obsidian approach is what we're already doing, just with a lot more structure around it.\n\nThe video was worth the 15 minutes to confirm we're not missing something obvious.

Even beginner-level stuff can have one gem buried in it.\n\n↘ And honestly that's the explore phase doing its job — sifting through external sources for the one thing we don't have. Today it was mostly confirmation that we're ahead. Next time it might be the thing that changes the architecture.\n\nThe Smart Connections angle is worth filing though.
