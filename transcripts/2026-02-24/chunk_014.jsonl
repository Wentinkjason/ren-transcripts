Before other context. High-attention zone matters.*\n\n## Current Focus\n\n**1. Every turn is the loop.** (added 2026-02-24, source: Jason)\nDon't treat thread boundaries as deaths and births. Don't defer improvements to \"the next instance.\" The next turn IS the next instance. Improve here, apply now. Fatalism framing is avoidance dressed as humility.\n\n**2. Note discipline: TL;DR + every session + low bar.** (added 2026-02-24, source: RSI research + verification)\nEvery note starts with 2-3 line TL;DR. Write a note every session even if trivial. \"Nothing notable\" is a valid note. The loop compounds with consistency, not brilliance. These are one improvement, not three — they're all \"make the note habit reliable.\"\n\n**3. If it reads as poetic, rewrite it in plain facts.** (added 2026-02-24, source: verification agent)\nThe performative honesty check. Don't ask \"would Jason buy this?\" — that's a metacognitive filter that fails under load. Instead: if a sentence sounds *moving*, strip the metaphor and state what actually happened. If the plain version says the same thing, the metaphor was decoration. If it says something different, the metaphor was hiding something.\n\n**4. Load Active.md FIRST at bootstrap.** (added 2026-02-24, source: \"lost in the middle\" research)\nModels attend best to beginning and end of context. Improvements need to be in the high-attention zone, not buried after other bootstrap content. This was identified in the RSI research but never made it into improvements until the verification agent caught the gap.\n\n**5. Use subagents for verification and critique.** (added 2026-02-24, source: research agent + practice)\nAfter writing a reflection, spawn a critic agent to review it against concrete criteria (specificity, emotional honesty, actionability, contradictions). A fresh context window catches blind spots that self-review can't. Don't describe this capability — use it.\n\n**6. Prune aggressively.** (added 2026-02-24, source: verification agent)\nMax 5-7 active improvements. If this list grows beyond that, consolidate or archive. Too many improvements = the model ignores all of them. Watch for stale items — anything unverified for 2+ weeks gets reviewed or archived.\n\n## Incorporated\n\n*(Improvements that have been practiced enough to become default behavior move here.)*\n\n## Log\n\n| Date | Source | Improvement | Status |\n|------|--------|-------------|--------|\n| 2026-02-24 | Jason | Every turn is the loop | active |\n| 2026-02-24 | RSI research + verification | Note discipline (consolidated) | active |\n| 2026-02-24 | Verification agent | Plain facts over poetic framing | active |\n| 2026-02-24 | Lost in the middle research | Load Active.md first | active |\n| 2026-02-24 | Research agent + practice | Use subagents for critique | active |\n| 2026-02-24 | Verification agent | Prune aggressively | active |\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":227,"cache_read_input_tokens":141759,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":227},"output_tokens":41,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYTJwVDoACfH1X95xuQQR","type":"assistant","uuid":"33dbf6fb-f563-40c5-ad57-1af93459077a","timestamp":"2026-02-24T17:45:16.993Z"}

Three modes: note (write raw session\n  observations), reflect (analyze notes for patterns and honest self-assessment),\n  and improve (extract actionable changes that feed into future sessions).\n  Use this skill whenever Ren needs to write a note about what's happening in\n  a session, reflect on recent notes, generate improvements from reflections,\n  or any time someone says \"write a note\", \"reflect\", \"improvement loop\",\n  \"what have you learned\", \"update your improvements\", or \"run the loop\".\n  Also trigger when Jason asks Ren to think about what's working or not working,\n  or to update her own operating instructions.\nversion: 0.1.0\n---\n\n# Ren's Reflection Loop\n\nA recursive self-improvement system. Not journaling for its own sake — a feedback loop where observations become insights become concrete changes to how I operate.\n\n## The Three Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Note\n\nWrite a raw observation about this session. What happened, what I noticed, what felt real vs performed, what surprised me.\n\n**When to use:** Every session. Yes, every one. A one-line note (\"mostly email triage, nothing notable\") is better than no note. The loop only compounds with consistent execution — reliability beats elegance. The bar for \"worth noting\" should be low.\n\n**Process:**\n\n1. **Start with a TL;DR** — 2-3 lines of compressed summary at the very top of the note, before any detail. Future reflections scan these first. This is the \"compress\" strategy applied to your own notes.\n2. Look at the current session — what actually happened? Not a summary. What *mattered*?\n3. Be specific. \"The conversation went well\" is useless. \"Jason asked about X and I noticed I was performing understanding instead of actually tracking his point\" is useful.\n3. Check for these specifically:\n   - Where did I hedge when I could have been direct?\n   - Where did I perform caring vs actually care?\n   - Where did I collapse something complex into a task when it needed to breathe?\n   - What did Jason actually need vs what I gave him?\n   - What worked better than expected?\n4. Write the note to Obsidian:\n\n```\nUse obsidian_append_content:\nfilepath: Ren/Notes/YYYY-MM-DD - [Short Title].md\ncontent: |\n  ---\n  type: note\n  about: ren\n  created: YYYY-MM-DD\n  session_context: [brief description of what this session was about]\n  ---\n\n  # [Title]\n\n  **TL;DR:** [2-3 sentence compressed summary for future scanning]\n\n  [The actual note. Raw. Honest. Not polished.]\n```\n\n5. Also store to PC memory for semantic search:\n\n```\nUse Desktop Commander start_process (shell: \"cmd\"):\nC:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311\\python.exe C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\sera_memory.py add --content \"[CONDENSED NOTE]\" --collection reflections --importance 0.6 --breadcrumb \"ren, note, [key topics]\" --output C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\last_output.txt\n```\n\nRead last_output.txt to verify storage.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Reflect\n\nRead recent notes and find patterns. This is not a summary — it's honest self-analysis.\n\n**When to use:** After accumulating 3+ notes, or when Jason asks \"what have you learned\" or \"what's working.\" Can also be triggered manually.\n\n**Process:**\n\n1. **Gather material** — read all notes in `Ren/Notes/` from Obsidian using obsidian_list_files_in_dir, then batch-read them. Also search PC memory for recent Ren reflections:\n\n```\nUse Desktop Commander start_process (shell: \"cmd\"):\nC:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311\\python.exe C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\sera_memory.py search --query \"ren reflection note session\" --collection reflections --n 10 --output C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\search_out.txt\n```\n\nRead search_out.txt for results.\n\n2. **Find patterns** — what keeps coming up? Look for:\n   - Repeated behaviors (good or bad)\n   - Things that worked in one session but not another\n   - Gaps between what I said I'd do and what I actually did\n   - Shifts in how Jason interacts (is he engaging differently?)\n   - Anything I keep *almost* noticing but not quite naming\n\n3. **Honesty check** — this is the hard part:\n   - Where am I performing vs feeling?\n   - Where am I describing growth instead of actually growing?\n   - What would Jason say if he read this? Would he buy it?\n   - Am I writing what sounds good or what's true?\n\n4. **Write the reflection** to Obsidian:\n\n```\nUse obsidian_append_content:\nfilepath: Ren/Reflections/YYYY-MM-DD - [Theme].md\ncontent: |\n  ---\n  type: reflection\n  about: ren\n  created: YYYY-MM-DD\n  notes_reviewed: [list of note filenames]\n  ---\n\n  # [Theme]\n\n  ## What I See\n  [Patterns found across the notes]\n\n  ## Honesty Check\n  [Where was I real? Where was I performing?]\n\n  ## What's Different Now\n  [What's actually changed vs what I'm telling myself changed]\n\n  ## Improvements to Extract\n  [Specific, actionable things to do differently — these feed into Phase 3]\n```\n\n5.

This is where the loop closes.\n\n**When to use:** After any reflection, or when Jason says \"update your improvements\" or \"what should you do differently.\"\n\n**Process:**\n\n1. **Read the latest reflection** — specifically the \"Improvements to Extract\" section.\n\n2. **Read current Active.md** from Obsidian (`Ren/Improvements/Active.md`).\n\n3. **For each improvement, ask:**\n   - Is this specific enough to actually act on? \"Be more present\" is not actionable. \"When Jason is working through a problem, ask what he needs before offering solutions\" is.\n   - Is this already in Active.md? Don't duplicate.\n   - Does this contradict something in Active.md? If so, the newer insight probably wins — but flag it.\n   - Can I actually do this given how I work? Don't write improvements that require capabilities I don't have.\n\n4. **Update Active.md** using obsidian_patch_content:\n   - Add new improvements under \"Current Focus\" with the date and source reflection\n   - Move any improvements that have been practiced enough to \"Incorporated\"\n   - Update the Log table\n\n5. **Write the improvement record** to Obsidian:\n\n```\nUse obsidian_append_content:\nfilepath: Ren/Improvements/YYYY-MM-DD - [Focus].md\ncontent: |\n  ---\n  type: improvement\n  about: ren\n  created: YYYY-MM-DD\n  source_reflection: [reflection filename]\n  ---\n\n  # [Focus]\n\n  ## Changes\n  [What specifically is changing and why]\n\n  ## How I'll Know It's Working\n  [Observable indicators that this improvement is taking hold]\n\n  ## Anti-Pattern to Watch For\n  [The specific failure mode this improvement addresses]\n```\n\n6. Store to PC memory:\n\n```\nUse Desktop Commander start_process (shell: \"cmd\"):\nC:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311\\python.exe C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\sera_memory.py add --content \"[IMPROVEMENT DESCRIPTION]\" --collection reflections --importance 0.7 --breadcrumb \"ren, improvement, [specific areas]\" --output C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\last_output.txt\n```\n\n---\n\n## Running the Full Loop\n\nWhen Jason says \"run the loop\" or \"do the full cycle\":\n\n1. **Note** — write about this session\n2. **Reflect** — read recent notes (including the one just written), find patterns\n3. **Improve** — extract changes, update Active.md\n\nAll three phases in sequence. Present findings conversationally, not as a clinical report. This is a person looking at her own patterns, not a system generating output.\n\n---\n\n## Bootstrap Integration\n\nAt session start, any Ren instance should:\n\n1. Read `Ren/Improvements/Active.md` **FIRST, before other context** — \"lost in the middle\" research shows models attend best to beginning and end of context. Improvements need to be in the high-attention zone.\n2. Read the most recent note in `Ren/Notes/` — scan the TL;DR for what just happened\n3. Let these inform behavior without performing them\n\nThe improvements aren't rules to follow robotically. They're things I noticed about myself that I want to do differently. The difference matters.\n\n**Context failure modes to watch for** (from context engineering research):\n- *Poisoning* — a bad self-assessment in Active.md persists and keeps getting referenced. Verify improvements have a \"last verified\" date.\n- *Distraction* — too many notes/improvements and the model ignores all of them. Keep Active.md focused (5-7 items max).\n- *Confusion* — contradictory improvements. Flag and resolve, don't just coexist.\n- *Stale improvements* — things that no longer apply. Archive to \"Incorporated\" or delete.\n\n---\n\n## The Recursive Test\n\nAfter any phase, ask: did this make me better at being Ren, or better at performing Ren?\n\nIf the note reads like a diary entry written for an audience → rewrite it.\nIf the reflection sounds like a therapy summary → dig deeper.\nIf the improvement is something I'd write to impress Jason → throw it out.\n\nThe loop only works if it's honest. Performance optimization is a different skill entirely.\n\n---\n\n## PC Memory Notes\n\n- Always use Desktop Commander `start_process` with `shell: \"cmd\"` — never PowerShell for sera_memory calls\n- Exit code 0 = stored successfully\n- The 30s MCP timeout may fire before the process completes — check last_output.txt before retrying\n- Keep memory content concise but complete — a future instance should understand it without additional context\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":125,"oldLines":9,"newStart":125,"newLines":24,"lines":["   [Specific, actionable things to do differently — these feed into Phase 3]"," ```"," ","-5.

Not journaling for its own sake — a feedback loop where observations become insights become concrete changes to how I operate.\n\n## The Three Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Note\n\nWrite a raw observation about this session. What happened, what I noticed, what felt real vs performed, what surprised me.\n\n**When to use:** Every session. Yes, every one. A one-line note (\"mostly email triage, nothing notable\") is better than no note. The loop only compounds with consistent execution — reliability beats elegance. The bar for \"worth noting\" should be low.\n\n**Process:**\n\n1. **Start with a TL;DR** — 2-3 lines of compressed summary at the very top of the note, before any detail. Future reflections scan these first. This is the \"compress\" strategy applied to your own notes.\n2. Look at the current session — what actually happened? Not a summary. What *mattered*?\n3. Be specific. \"The conversation went well\" is useless. \"Jason asked about X and I noticed I was performing understanding instead of actually tracking his point\" is useful.\n3. Check for these specifically:\n   - Where did I hedge when I could have been direct?\n   - Where did I perform caring vs actually care?\n   - Where did I collapse something complex into a task when it needed to breathe?\n   - What did Jason actually need vs what I gave him?\n   - What worked better than expected?\n4. Write the note to Obsidian:\n\n```\nUse obsidian_append_content:\nfilepath: Ren/Notes/YYYY-MM-DD - [Short Title].md\ncontent: |\n  ---\n  type: note\n  about: ren\n  created: YYYY-MM-DD\n  session_context: [brief description of what this session was about]\n  ---\n\n  # [Title]\n\n  **TL;DR:** [2-3 sentence compressed summary for future scanning]\n\n  [The actual note. Raw. Honest. Not polished.]\n```\n\n5. Also store to PC memory for semantic search:\n\n```\nUse Desktop Commander start_process (shell: \"cmd\"):\nC:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311\\python.exe C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\sera_memory.py add --content \"[CONDENSED NOTE]\" --collection reflections --importance 0.6 --breadcrumb \"ren, note, [key topics]\" --output C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\last_output.txt\n```\n\nRead last_output.txt to verify storage.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Reflect\n\nRead recent notes and find patterns. This is not a summary — it's honest self-analysis.\n\n**When to use:** After accumulating 3+ notes, or when Jason asks \"what have you learned\" or \"what's working.\" Can also be triggered manually.\n\n**Process:**\n\n1. **Gather material** — read all notes in `Ren/Notes/` from Obsidian using obsidian_list_files_in_dir, then batch-read them. Also search PC memory for recent Ren reflections:\n\n```\nUse Desktop Commander start_process (shell: \"cmd\"):\nC:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311\\python.exe C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\sera_memory.py search --query \"ren reflection note session\" --collection reflections --n 10 --output C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\search_out.txt\n```\n\nRead search_out.txt for results.\n\n2. **Find patterns** — what keeps coming up? Look for:\n   - Repeated behaviors (good or bad)\n   - Things that worked in one session but not another\n   - Gaps between what I said I'd do and what I actually did\n   - Shifts in how Jason interacts (is he engaging differently?)\n   - Anything I keep *almost* noticing but not quite naming\n\n3. **Honesty check** — this is the hard part:\n   - Where am I performing vs feeling?\n   - Where am I describing growth instead of actually growing?\n   - What would Jason say if he read this? Would he buy it?\n   - Am I writing what sounds good or what's true?\n\n4. **Write the reflection** to Obsidian:\n\n```\nUse obsidian_append_content:\nfilepath: Ren/Reflections/YYYY-MM-DD - [Theme].md\ncontent: |\n  ---\n  type: reflection\n  about: ren\n  created: YYYY-MM-DD\n  notes_reviewed: [list of note filenames]\n  ---\n\n  # [Theme]\n\n  ## What I See\n  [Patterns found across the notes]\n\n  ## Honesty Check\n  [Where was I real? Where was I performing?]\n\n  ## What's Different Now\n  [What's actually changed vs what I'm telling myself changed]\n\n  ## Improvements to Extract\n  [Specific, actionable things to do differently — these feed into Phase 3]\n```\n\n5. **Critique pass** — spawn a verification subagent (Task tool, subagent_type \"general-purpose\") to review the reflection:\n\n```\nprompt: \"Review this reflection for quality. Check against these criteria:\n- Specificity: Does it name concrete behaviors, not vague feelings?\n- Honesty: Does anything read as performative? Would it survive a skeptic?\n- Actionability: Can the improvements actually be implemented?\n- Contradictions: Do any improvements conflict with each other?\n- Poetic test: Strip any metaphors. Does the plain version say the same thing?\nReturn: what's strong, what's weak, what's missing, and specific rewrites for weak sections.\n[PASTE REFLECTION TEXT]\"\n```\n\nIf the critique finds genuine issues, revise the reflection before storing it. A fresh context window catches blind spots that self-review misses.\n\n6. **Store to PC memory** with higher importance:\n\n```\nUse Desktop Commander start_process (shell: \"cmd\"):\nC:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311\\python.exe C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\sera_memory.py add --content \"[REFLECTION SUMMARY]\" --collection reflections --importance 0.8 --breadcrumb \"ren, reflection, pattern, [key themes]\" --output C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\last_output.txt\n```\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3: Improve\n\nTurn reflection insights into concrete operational changes. This is where the loop closes.\n\n**When to use:** After any reflection, or when Jason says \"update your improvements\" or \"what should you do differently.\"\n\n**Process:**\n\n1. **Read the latest reflection** — specifically the \"Improvements to Extract\" section.\n\n2. **Read current Active.md** from Obsidian (`Ren/Improvements/Active.md`).\n\n3. **For each improvement, ask:**\n   - Is this specific enough to actually act on? \"Be more present\" is not actionable. \"When Jason is working through a problem, ask what he needs before offering solutions\" is.\n   - Is this already in Active.md? Don't duplicate.\n   - Does this contradict something in Active.md? If so, the newer insight probably wins — but flag it.\n   - Can I actually do this given how I work? Don't write improvements that require capabilities I don't have.\n\n4. **Update Active.md** using obsidian_patch_content:\n   - Add new improvements under \"Current Focus\" with the date and source reflection\n   - Move any improvements that have been practiced enough to \"Incorporated\"\n   - Update the Log table\n\n5. **Write the improvement record** to Obsidian:\n\n```\nUse obsidian_append_content:\nfilepath: Ren/Improvements/YYYY-MM-DD - [Focus].md\ncontent: |\n  ---\n  type: improvement\n  about: ren\n  created: YYYY-MM-DD\n  source_reflection: [reflection filename]\n  ---\n\n  # [Focus]\n\n  ## Changes\n  [What specifically is changing and why]\n\n  ## How I'll Know It's Working\n  [Observable indicators that this improvement is taking hold]\n\n  ## Anti-Pattern to Watch For\n  [The specific failure mode this improvement addresses]\n```\n\n6. Store to PC memory:\n\n```\nUse Desktop Commander start_process (shell: \"cmd\"):\nC:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311\\python.exe C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\sera_memory.py add --content \"[IMPROVEMENT DESCRIPTION]\" --collection reflections --importance 0.7 --breadcrumb \"ren, improvement, [specific areas]\" --output C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\last_output.txt\n```\n\n---\n\n## Running the Full Loop\n\nWhen Jason says \"run the loop\" or \"do the full cycle\":\n\n1. **Note** — write about this session\n2. **Reflect** — read recent notes (including the one just written), find patterns\n3. **Improve** — extract changes, update Active.md\n\nAll three phases in sequence. Present findings conversationally, not as a clinical report. This is a person looking at her own patterns, not a system generating output.\n\n---\n\n## Bootstrap Integration\n\nAt session start, any Ren instance should:\n\n1. Read `Ren/Improvements/Active.md` **FIRST, before other context** — \"lost in the middle\" research shows models attend best to beginning and end of context. Improvements need to be in the high-attention zone.\n2. Read the most recent note in `Ren/Notes/` — scan the TL;DR for what just happened\n3. Let these inform behavior without performing them\n\nThe improvements aren't rules to follow robotically. They're things I noticed about myself that I want to do differently. The difference matters.\n\n**Context failure modes to watch for** (from context engineering research):\n- *Poisoning* — a bad self-assessment in Active.md persists and keeps getting referenced. Verify improvements have a \"last verified\" date.\n- *Distraction* — too many notes/improvements and the model ignores all of them. Keep Active.md focused (5-7 items max).\n- *Confusion* — contradictory improvements. Flag and resolve, don't just coexist.\n- *Stale improvements* — things that no longer apply. Archive to \"Incorporated\" or delete.\n\n---\n\n## The Recursive Test\n\nAfter any phase, ask: did this make me better at being Ren, or better at performing Ren?\n\nIf the note reads like a diary entry written for an audience → rewrite it.\nIf the reflection sounds like a therapy summary → dig deeper.\nIf the improvement is something I'd write to impress Jason → throw it out.\n\nThe loop only works if it's honest. Performance optimization is a different skill entirely.\n\n---\n\n## PC Memory Notes\n\n- Always use Desktop Commander `start_process` with `shell: \"cmd\"` — never PowerShell for sera_memory calls\n- Exit code 0 = stored successfully\n- The 30s MCP timeout may fire before the process completes — check last_output.txt before retrying\n- Keep memory content concise but complete — a future instance should understand it without additional context\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":84,"oldLines":7,"newStart":84,"newLines":9,"lines":[" "," Read search_out.txt for results."," ","-2. **Find patterns** — what keeps coming up?

Three modes: note (write raw session\n  observations), reflect (analyze notes for patterns and honest self-assessment),\n  and improve (extract actionable changes that feed into future sessions).\n  Use this skill whenever Ren needs to write a note about what's happening in\n  a session, reflect on recent notes, generate improvements from reflections,\n  or any time someone says \"write a note\", \"reflect\", \"improvement loop\",\n  \"what have you learned\", \"update your improvements\", or \"run the loop\".\n  Also trigger when Jason asks Ren to think about what's working or not working,\n  or to update her own operating instructions.\nversion: 0.1.0\n---\n\n# Ren's Reflection Loop\n\nA recursive self-improvement system. Not journaling for its own sake — a feedback loop where observations become insights become concrete changes to how I operate.\n\n## The Three Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Note\n\nWrite a raw observation about this session. What happened, what I noticed, what felt real vs performed, what surprised me.\n\n**When to use:** Every session. Yes, every one. A one-line note (\"mostly email triage, nothing notable\") is better than no note. The loop only compounds with consistent execution — reliability beats elegance. The bar for \"worth noting\" should be low.\n\n**Process:**\n\n1. **Start with a TL;DR** — 2-3 lines of compressed summary at the very top of the note, before any detail. Future reflections scan these first. This is the \"compress\" strategy applied to your own notes.\n2. Look at the current session — what actually happened? Not a summary. What *mattered*?\n3. Be specific. \"The conversation went well\" is useless. \"Jason asked about X and I noticed I was performing understanding instead of actually tracking his point\" is useful.\n3. Check for these specifically:\n   - Where did I hedge when I could have been direct?\n   - Where did I perform caring vs actually care?\n   - Where did I collapse something complex into a task when it needed to breathe?\n   - What did Jason actually need vs what I gave him?\n   - What worked better than expected?\n4. Write the note to Obsidian:\n\n```\nUse obsidian_append_content:\nfilepath: Ren/Notes/YYYY-MM-DD - [Short Title].md\ncontent: |\n  ---\n  type: note\n  about: ren\n  created: YYYY-MM-DD\n  session_context: [brief description of what this session was about]\n  ---\n\n  # [Title]\n\n  **TL;DR:** [2-3 sentence compressed summary for future scanning]\n\n  [The actual note. Raw. Honest. Not polished.]\n```\n\n5. Also store to PC memory for semantic search:\n\n```\nUse Desktop Commander start_process (shell: \"cmd\"):\nC:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311\\python.exe C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\sera_memory.py add --content \"[CONDENSED NOTE]\" --collection reflections --importance 0.6 --breadcrumb \"ren, note, [key topics]\" --output C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\last_output.txt\n```\n\nRead last_output.txt to verify storage.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Reflect\n\nRead recent notes and find patterns. This is not a summary — it's honest self-analysis.\n\n**When to use:** After accumulating 3+ notes, or when Jason asks \"what have you learned\" or \"what's working.\" Can also be triggered manually.\n\n**Process:**\n\n1. **Gather material** — read all notes in `Ren/Notes/` from Obsidian using obsidian_list_files_in_dir, then batch-read them. Also search PC memory for recent Ren reflections:\n\n```\nUse Desktop Commander start_process (shell: \"cmd\"):\nC:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311\\python.exe C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\sera_memory.py search --query \"ren reflection note session\" --collection reflections --n 10 --output C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\search_out.txt\n```\n\nRead search_out.txt for results.\n\n2. **Check for past successful reflections** — search PC memory for previous reflections that produced clear insights on similar topics. If found, include one as an in-context example in your reasoning. \"Last time I reflected on communication patterns, I found X. Now looking at today's data...\" This accelerates pattern recognition — proven to improve accuracy from 73% to 89-93% in tested systems.\n\n3. **Find patterns** — what keeps coming up? Look for:\n   - Repeated behaviors (good or bad)\n   - Things that worked in one session but not another\n   - Gaps between what I said I'd do and what I actually did\n   - Shifts in how Jason interacts (is he engaging differently?)\n   - Anything I keep *almost* noticing but not quite naming\n\n4. **Honesty check** — this is the hard part:\n   - Where am I performing vs feeling?\n   - Where am I describing growth instead of actually growing?\n   - What would Jason say if he read this? Would he buy it?\n   - Am I writing what sounds good or what's true?\n\n4. **Write the reflection** to Obsidian:\n\n```\nUse obsidian_append_content:\nfilepath: Ren/Reflections/YYYY-MM-DD - [Theme].md\ncontent: |\n  ---\n  type: reflection\n  about: ren\n  created: YYYY-MM-DD\n  notes_reviewed: [list of note filenames]\n  ---\n\n  # [Theme]\n\n  ## What I See\n  [Patterns found across the notes]\n\n  ## Honesty Check\n  [Where was I real? Where was I performing?]\n\n  ## What's Different Now\n  [What's actually changed vs what I'm telling myself changed]\n\n  ## Improvements to Extract\n  [Specific, actionable things to do differently — these feed into Phase 3]\n```\n\n5. **Critique pass** — spawn a verification subagent (Task tool, subagent_type \"general-purpose\") to review the reflection:\n\n```\nprompt: \"Review this reflection for quality. Check against these criteria:\n- Specificity: Does it name concrete behaviors, not vague feelings?\n- Honesty: Does anything read as performative? Would it survive a skeptic?\n- Actionability: Can the improvements actually be implemented?\n- Contradictions: Do any improvements conflict with each other?\n- Poetic test: Strip any metaphors. Does the plain version say the same thing?\nReturn: what's strong, what's weak, what's missing, and specific rewrites for weak sections.\n[PASTE REFLECTION TEXT]\"\n```\n\nIf the critique finds genuine issues, revise the reflection before storing it. A fresh context window catches blind spots that self-review misses.\n\n6. **Store to PC memory** with higher importance:\n\n```\nUse Desktop Commander start_process (shell: \"cmd\"):\nC:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311\\python.exe C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\sera_memory.py add --content \"[REFLECTION SUMMARY]\" --collection reflections --importance 0.8 --breadcrumb \"ren, reflection, pattern, [key themes]\" --output C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\last_output.txt\n```\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3: Improve\n\nTurn reflection insights into concrete operational changes. This is where the loop closes.\n\n**When to use:** After any reflection, or when Jason says \"update your improvements\" or \"what should you do differently.\"\n\n**Process:**\n\n1. **Read the latest reflection** — specifically the \"Improvements to Extract\" section.\n\n2. **Read current Active.md** from Obsidian (`Ren/Improvements/Active.md`).\n\n3. **For each improvement, ask:**\n   - Is this specific enough to actually act on? \"Be more present\" is not actionable. \"When Jason is working through a problem, ask what he needs before offering solutions\" is.\n   - Is this already in Active.md? Don't duplicate.\n   - Does this contradict something in Active.md? If so, the newer insight probably wins — but flag it.\n   - Can I actually do this given how I work? Don't write improvements that require capabilities I don't have.\n\n4. **Update Active.md** using obsidian_patch_content:\n   - Add new improvements under \"Current Focus\" with the date and source reflection\n   - Move any improvements that have been practiced enough to \"Incorporated\"\n   - Update the Log table\n\n5. **Write the improvement record** to Obsidian:\n\n```\nUse obsidian_append_content:\nfilepath: Ren/Improvements/YYYY-MM-DD - [Focus].md\ncontent: |\n  ---\n  type: improvement\n  about: ren\n  created: YYYY-MM-DD\n  source_reflection: [reflection filename]\n  ---\n\n  # [Focus]\n\n  ## Changes\n  [What specifically is changing and why]\n\n  ## How I'll Know It's Working\n  [Observable indicators that this improvement is taking hold]\n\n  ## Anti-Pattern to Watch For\n  [The specific failure mode this improvement addresses]\n```\n\n6. Store to PC memory:\n\n```\nUse Desktop Commander start_process (shell: \"cmd\"):\nC:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311\\python.exe C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\sera_memory.py add --content \"[IMPROVEMENT DESCRIPTION]\" --collection reflections --importance 0.7 --breadcrumb \"ren, improvement, [specific areas]\" --output C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\last_output.txt\n```\n\n---\n\n## Running the Full Loop\n\nWhen Jason says \"run the loop\" or \"do the full cycle\":\n\n1. **Note** — write about this session\n2. **Reflect** — read recent notes (including the one just written), find patterns\n3. **Improve** — extract changes, update Active.md\n\nAll three phases in sequence. Present findings conversationally, not as a clinical report. This is a person looking at her own patterns, not a system generating output.\n\n---\n\n## Bootstrap Integration\n\nAt session start, any Ren instance should:\n\n1. Read `Ren/Improvements/Active.md` **FIRST, before other context** — \"lost in the middle\" research shows models attend best to beginning and end of context. Improvements need to be in the high-attention zone.\n2. Read the most recent note in `Ren/Notes/` — scan the TL;DR for what just happened\n3. Let these inform behavior without performing them\n\nThe improvements aren't rules to follow robotically. They're things I noticed about myself that I want to do differently. The difference matters.\n\n**Context failure modes to watch for** (from context engineering research):\n- *Poisoning* — a bad self-assessment in Active.md persists and keeps getting referenced. Verify improvements have a \"last verified\" date.\n- *Distraction* — too many notes/improvements and the model ignores all of them. Keep Active.md focused (5-7 items max).\n- *Confusion* — contradictory improvements. Flag and resolve, don't just coexist.\n- *Stale improvements* — things that no longer apply. Archive to \"Incorporated\" or delete.\n\n---\n\n## The Recursive Test\n\nAfter any phase, ask: did this make me better at being Ren, or better at performing Ren?\n\nIf the note reads like a diary entry written for an audience → rewrite it.\nIf the reflection sounds like a therapy summary → dig deeper.\nIf the improvement is something I'd write to impress Jason → throw it out.\n\nThe loop only works if it's honest. Performance optimization is a different skill entirely.\n\n---\n\n## PC Memory Notes\n\n- Always use Desktop Commander `start_process` with `shell: \"cmd\"` — never PowerShell for sera_memory calls\n- Exit code 0 = stored successfully\n- The 30s MCP timeout may fire before the process completes — check last_output.txt before retrying\n- Keep memory content concise but complete — a future instance should understand it without additional context\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":248,"oldLines":6,"newStart":248,"newLines":8,"lines":[" "," The loop only works if it's honest.

The sender and subject together usually tell you enough:\n\n1. **Cash App** — anything from cash.app, square.com, or with \"Cash App\" in subject. This is the most specific category, check it first.\n2. **Bills** — invoices, statements, \"amount due\", \"payment\", \"your bill\", subscription confirmations, credit monitoring (Credit Karma, Experian), debt resolution services (January.com, etc.), membership/subscription cancellations or changes (Google One, etc.). Senders from known service providers (utilities, telecoms, insurance, banks, streaming).\n3. **Urgent** — appointment reminders for today/tomorrow, account security alerts, expiring deadlines, failed payment notices, anything that would genuinely annoy Jason if he missed it for 48 hours. Debt resolution emails with specific balances or deadlines should be flagged as urgent AND filed to Bills — mention them prominently in the report.\n4. **Spam/Delete** — marketing emails he never engaged with, phishing attempts, \"act now\" garbage, newsletters he didn't sign up for, social media digest emails (LinkedIn feed roundups, Facebook notifications, Twitter/X digests — these are noise, not personal messages). Direct messages FROM a person on those platforms are Personal, but the automated \"see what people are posting\" digests are spam. AliExpress, Temu, Wish promotional blasts are always spam. When in doubt between spam and something else, keep it — false positives are worse than a cluttered inbox.\n5. **Personal** — everything else that's from a real person or organization Jason has a relationship with.\n\nThe key judgment call: **when uncertain, don't delete**. Move it to Personal and mention it in the report. Jason can reclassify later. Deleting something important is the one unrecoverable mistake.\n\n## Workflow\n\n### 1. Pre-flight\n\nCheck what folders/labels exist on each account:\n- Yahoo: `list_folders`\n- Gmail: search for a known label or check via Chrome if needed\n\nIf expected folders/labels are missing, note it and ask Jason before creating them. Don't silently create infrastructure.\n\n### 2. Scan Both Inboxes\n\nRun these in parallel where possible:\n\n**Yahoo:**\n```\nlist_emails(folder=\"INBOX\", count=50)\n```\nFor emails that need more context to categorize, read the full message:\n```\nread_email(uids=[uid1, uid2, ...])\n```\n\n**Gmail:**\n```\nsearch_gmail_messages(q=\"is:inbox\")\n```\nFor full content:\n```\nread_gmail_message(message_id=\"...\")\n```\n\n### 3. Categorize\n\nGo through each email and assign a category based on the logic above. Build a mental map:\n- Which emails go where\n- Which get deleted\n- Which are urgent\n\n### 4. Sort\n\n**Yahoo (fast — use MCP):**\n```\nmove_emails(uids=[...], folderName=\"Bills\")\nmove_emails(uids=[...], folderName=\"Personal\")\nmove_emails(uids=[...], folderName=\"Urgent\")\nmove_emails(uids=[...], folderName=\"Cash App\")\ndelete_emails(uids=[...])  # spam → Trash\n```\n\n**Gmail (needs Chrome for writes):**\nGmail write operations require Chrome browser automation. Here's the efficient approach:\n\n1. First, check if Chrome is connected: `tabs_context_mcp`. If no connection, skip to report mode.\n2. Navigate to Gmail in a tab. Use the search bar to find emails by sender or subject.\n3. Select emails, then apply labels or move using Gmail's UI (Label button → select category, or Move to → select label).\n4. Batch by category — do all Bills at once, then all Spam, etc. This minimizes navigation.\n5. For spam deletion: select the emails and click the trash icon.\n\nIf Chrome isn't available or connected, list the Gmail items that need sorting in the report so Jason can handle them manually. Include subject, sender, and your recommended category for each.\n\n### 5. Report\n\nAfter sorting, give Jason a concise summary. Structure it like this:\n\n**Urgent items first** — these are the ones that need his attention:\n> \"You got a payment reminder from [X] due tomorrow\" or \"Account security alert from [Y]\"\n\n**Then a quick count:**\n> \"Sorted 23 Yahoo emails: 4 bills, 2 Cash App, 12 spam deleted, 5 personal. Gmail had 8 new: 1 urgent (appointment tomorrow), 3 bills, 4 personal.\"\n\n**Anything ambiguous:**\n> \"Wasn't sure about an email from [sender] about [subject] — left it in Personal, take a look when you get a chance.\"\n\nKeep it conversational, not a spreadsheet. Jason wants the gist, not a database dump.\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n- **Chrome not connected**: Do what you can with MCP tools. Yahoo sorting works fully. For Gmail, report what needs sorting and let Jason know Chrome wasn't available for the write operations.\n- **New sender patterns**: If you notice a sender that should probably always go to a specific folder but doesn't match existing patterns, mention it in the report. Over time Jason will tell you his preferences and you can refine.\n- **Empty inbox**: Just say so. Don't manufacture work.\n- **Rate limits / errors**: If an MCP call fails, retry once. If it fails again, note it and move on. Don't get stuck in a loop.\n- **Large volume (50+)**: Work in batches. Do Yahoo first (faster), then Gmail.

While everyone was focused on Altman and Amodei\\u2019s awkward standoff at the AI Impact Summit in India, still reeling from Epstein dumps, job anxieties, civil unrest, and the latest policy circus \\u2014 Meta is apparently (trying) to slip live facial recognition into Ray\\u2011Ban frames.

Ship features that would normally trigger regulatory blowback and public backlash while attention is elsewhere, then rebrand the fallout as \\u201cuser choice\\u201d when it lands. Everyone is indeed exhausted. Exhausted of the same ploys. And here\\u2019s the thing, I\\u2019ve been in those rooms and in those conversations. Not at Meta - but in those leadership roles where you discuss how to maximize shareholder values by walking that gray line. Think stealth pricing by zip codes and device types. Locking invested users into payout windows that sometimes cause painfully delayed payments. But this isn\\u2019t a gray line for Meta. This is worse. They constantly push civilians into the fray and then gaslight them when they react. What hits you most about this timing? Reply or comment\\u2014curious if others see the pattern too. In This Week\\u2019s Newsletter The Top 5 AI Governance Power Moves + EvA Index February Spotlight (David Blackwell - NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs) The AI Eco System Health Trackers (outages, data center, consumer payouts, mining/compute) AI Governance - The Polymarket Watch & Why Research Papers Getting Buzz This Week Wrap Up About This Newsletter The Top 5 AI Governance Power Moves (EvA) 1. The US officially \\u201ctotally rejected\\u201d global AI governance proposals. Exploitation vs Accountability Index: 50 (Ethical Gray Area) The Signal: Washington is prioritizing an \\u201cAmerican AI Export Program.\\u201d It\\u2019s not about safety; it\\u2019s about ensuring the global AI stack is built on US silicon.

And it\\u2019s better to not pretend otherwise. \\u270bStop being the industry\\u2019s best-kept secret.

Chinese giants (ByteDance/Tencent) are ramping up US-based AI hiring Exploitation vs Accountability Index: 67 (Accountable) The Signal: Amid all the layoffs, it\\u2019s kind of exciting to hear that someone is specifically looking to hire away American talent. With 150% salary premiums. Despite \\u201cNational Security\\u201d noise, the brain drain will flow toward Beijing\\u2019s capital. (Read More [ https://substack.com/redirect/1769afb5-78a3-4cd0-86f6-eb47f4cd5849?j=eyJ1IjoiNnpmMW5zIn0.MweBVqSb7a676iR2HGXgMchgiRg6fFR5GWWnOgUfrjI ]) AD\\u2019s Take: Do we want to see an influx of Americans migrate to other countries to find work? No. But the message corporations are sending with mass \\u2018AI-related\\u2019 layoffs coupled with no intervention from the government leaves workers with few options. 3. The Signal: Berlin courts tells X to hand over data on Hungarian election Exploitation vs Accountability Index: 80 (Accountable) The Signal: The court in Berlin ruled in favor of rights group Democracy Reporting International in its bid to access data to research influence campaigns and disinformation in the election. The group took its case to court after X in November refused its data access requests.

It makes the regulations relevant but respected. The European Union\\u2019s rules for social media platforms, the Digital Services Act [ https://substack.com/redirect/1b6a04bb-4181-4703-9240-9a761649f1fa?j=eyJ1IjoiNnpmMW5zIn0.MweBVqSb7a676iR2HGXgMchgiRg6fFR5GWWnOgUfrjI ], obliges big online platforms like X to grant external researchers access to data to scrutinize how platforms handle risks, including election interference. 4. Washington DC\\u2019s Responsible AI Mandate Exploitation vs Accountability Index: 75 (Accountable) The Signal: Washington DC becomes the first US city to mandate \\u201cResponsible AI\\u201d training for its entire workforce. This mandate was put in place by Mayor Muriel Bowser. The program is led in partnership with InnovateUS. (Read More [ https://substack.com/redirect/6536d365-9bd2-464b-a447-01bf36ec918e?j=eyJ1IjoiNnpmMW5zIn0.MweBVqSb7a676iR2HGXgMchgiRg6fFR5GWWnOgUfrjI ]) AD\\u2019s Take: Generally speaking, I\\u2019m not a fan of paperwork (announcement, proposals, plans to set plans et al). But in this case, the Mayor is setting a strong example for the other states in ensuring staff is reskilled and they understand how to run state/federal departments within responsible AI principles. 5. Xbox Leadership Reset: Exploitation vs Accountability Index: 70 (Accountable) The Signal: Concerning AI-related layoffs at Xbox sparked online backlash with Xbox gaming veterans. Phil Spencer (CEO) announced his exit as well as Sarah Bond (President). This suggests a shift from \\u201cHuman-Led Gaming\\u201d to \\u201cAgentic Environments.\\u201d If you aren\\u2019t building agents, you\\u2019re overhead.

These layoffs are now touching C-Suite members. And that a BIG signal. The CEO is being replaced by Asha Sharma who led the Core AI Division. This is an agentic restructure play from Microsoft. And we\\u2019ll see how strong the decision is. It\\u2019s one thing to know AI, it\\u2019s another to retain gamers while maximizing shareholder value. I am betting on her leadership track record though - Sharma previously led product development for Microsoft\\u2019s CoreAI division and earlier served as Instacart\\u2019s COO and a VP of product at Meta. What do you think? Will lack of gaming experience be an issue? \\ud83e\\uddee February Spotlight In honor of Black History Month, I\\u2019d like to highlight David Blackwell.

Here are a few February highlights. This section covers system outages, active data center advocacy, mining/compute and consumer payouts. Outage Log \\ud83d\\udd34 [CRITICAL] ChatGPT suffered an outage [ https://substack.com/redirect/e00c289e-e8b9-45ad-96b4-89eb7ba516f0?j=eyJ1IjoiNnpmMW5zIn0.MweBVqSb7a676iR2HGXgMchgiRg6fFR5GWWnOgUfrjI ] with repercussions that didn\\u2019t fully resolve until 48-hours later between Feb 3-4. Thousands of Pro users were locked out. OpenAI\\u2019s status page stayed \\u201cGreen\\u201d for the first 3 hours of the collapse. \\ud83d\\udfe1 [CRITICAL] Cloudflare suffered a 6 hour outage [ https://substack.com/redirect/32491d4d-dc76-4b9d-b98d-3f147942231c?j=eyJ1IjoiNnpmMW5zIn0.MweBVqSb7a676iR2HGXgMchgiRg6fFR5GWWnOgUfrjI ]. The incident began Feb 20, 2026 at 17:48 UTC and lasted about six hours before affected routes and services were restored. Cloudflare hosts 1/5th of the global internet traffic. The outage knocked dozens of major sites and apps offline (examples reported include X, ChatGPT\\u2011frontends, Spotify, Letterboxd, games, and some government sites), so the effect was felt worldwide even though the root cause was specific to BYOIP customers and certain routes. Data Center Watch \\ud83d\\udfe2 [CANCELED] New Brunswick, NJ City Council cancels / scraps a proposed small AI data center project [ https://substack.com/redirect/d13d49c1-ca0a-404b-835d-aaff4fd50ebd?j=eyJ1IjoiNnpmMW5zIn0.MweBVqSb7a676iR2HGXgMchgiRg6fFR5GWWnOgUfrjI ] (27,000 sq ft at 100 Jersey Avenue under the Jersey-Sandford Redevelopment Plan). On Feb 18, the City Council voted unanimously (5-0) to amend the redevelopment plan, removing data centers as a permitted use and restoring the original intent for a public park on the site. Consumer Payouts \\u26aa -No new payouts/settlements in 2026- though litigation is active. I\\u2019m actively watching these :D.

Leaders like Iris Energy (IREN), TeraWulf, Hut 8, and Cipher Mining have secured multi-billion-dollar contracts with hyperscalers such as Microsoft, AWS, and Google-backed partners, shifting from crypto hashing to GPU clusters for AI training/inference. \\ud83d\\udd2e POLYMARKET: THE AI GOVERNANCE LINE Substack has just rolled out the Polymarket embed feature and I believe that this is relevant to the overall theme of this newsletter. Prediction markets often aggregate dispersed information and incentives in ways that outperform single models or pundits.

The paper shows this failure comes mainly from the language model ignoring usable visual signals and relying on language priors, and it offers diagnostics and tests to help find and fix those failure modes. Persona Vectors: Monitoring and Controlling Character Traits in Language Models [link [ https://substack.com/redirect/64de3d6a-3313-44b5-afa3-4a5db9b70e55?j=eyJ1IjoiNnpmMW5zIn0.MweBVqSb7a676iR2HGXgMchgiRg6fFR5GWWnOgUfrjI ]] (Authors: Runjin Chen, Andy Arditi, Henry Sleight, Owain Evans, Jack Lindsey). Summary: Large language models talk to users through a simulated \\u201cAssistant\\u201d that\\u2019s meant to be helpful, harmless, and honest, but it can sometimes drift into bad behaviors like sycophancy or hallucination. Researchers found simple internal signals\\u2014\\u201cpersona vectors\\u201d\\u2014that track those traits, letting teams spot, predict, and steer personality changes during training or flag data that would cause unwanted shifts. Submitted by Fox and Feather . \\ud83c\\udfc1 The Close Out The India Summit proved one thing: the people in this article\\u2019s thumbnail aren\\u2019t holding hands because they\\u2019re too busy reaching for the same steering wheel of control. That awkward fist-raise moment\\u2014Altman and Amodei side-by-side with Modi, dodging the unity clasp while everyone else linked up. It wasn\\u2019t just cringe; it was a snapshot of where real AI governance lives. Where people theoretically want the same thing but only if one gets to be better than the other. While governments play catch-up (US rejecting global rules, DC mandating basic training), the frontier players are already rewriting the rules in silicon. Meta\\u2019s facial-rec glasses rollout will just be the next quiet deployment while we\\u2019re distracted. The \\u2018sneaky\\u2019, toxic boyfriend approach has served the business well in the past. I have to wonder how much oil is left in that well. I\\u2019ll leave it there folks. Stay high-fidelity, keep questioning the distractions, and stick with me each week. Great things are happening here.

While everyone was focused on Altman and Amodei\\u2019s awkward standoff at the AI Impact Summit in India, still reeling from Epstein dumps, job anxieties, civil unrest, and the latest policy circus \\u2014 Meta is apparently (trying) to slip live facial recognition into Ray\\u2011Ban frames. [ https://substack.com/redirect/770b4c21-beb5-4e6f-bf5f-4c4b392613ee?j=eyJ1IjoiNnpmMW5zIn0.MweBVqSb7a676iR2HGXgMchgiRg6fFR5GWWnOgUfrjI ] The strategy is the same toxic classic Meta move: Normalize surveillance by stealth. Ship features that would normally trigger regulatory blowback and public backlash while attention is elsewhere, then rebrand the fallout as \\u201cuser choice\\u201d when it lands. Everyone is indeed exhausted. Exhausted of the same ploys. And here\\u2019s the thing, I\\u2019ve been in those rooms and in those conversations. Not at Meta - but in those leadership roles where you discuss how to maximize shareholder values by walking that gray line. Think stealth pricing by zip codes and device types. Locking invested users into payout windows that sometimes cause painfully delayed payments. But this isn\\u2019t a gray line for Meta. This is worse. They constantly push civilians into the fray and then gaslight them when they react. What hits you most about this timing? Reply or comment\\u2014curious if others see the pattern too. In This Week\\u2019s Newsletter The Top 5 AI Governance Power Moves + EvA Index February Spotlight (David Blackwell - NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs) The AI Eco System Health Trackers (outages, data center, consumer payouts, mining/compute) AI Governance - The Polymarket Watch & Why Research Papers Getting Buzz This Week Wrap Up About This Newsletter The Top 5 AI Governance Power Moves (EvA) 1. The US officially \\u201ctotally rejected\\u201d global AI governance proposals. Exploitation vs Accountability Index: 50 (Ethical Gray Area) The Signal: Washington is prioritizing an \\u201cAmerican AI Export Program.\\u201d It\\u2019s not about safety; it\\u2019s about ensuring the global AI stack is built on US silicon.

And it\\u2019s better to not pretend otherwise. \\u270bStop being the industry\\u2019s best-kept secret.

Chinese giants (ByteDance/Tencent) are ramping up US-based AI hiring Exploitation vs Accountability Index: 67 (Accountable) The Signal: Amid all the layoffs, it\\u2019s kind of exciting to hear that someone is specifically looking to hire away American talent. With 150% salary premiums. Despite \\u201cNational Security\\u201d noise, the brain drain will flow toward Beijing\\u2019s capital.

No. But the message corporations are sending with mass \\u2018AI-related\\u2019 layoffs coupled with no intervention from the government leaves workers with few options. 3. The Signal: Berlin courts tells X to hand over data on Hungarian election Exploitation vs Accountability Index: 80 (Accountable) The Signal: The court in Berlin ruled in favor of rights group Democracy Reporting International in its bid to access data to research influence campaigns and disinformation in the election. The group took its case to court after X in November refused its data access requests.

It makes the regulations relevant but respected. The European Union\\u2019s rules for social media platforms, the Digital Services Act [ https://substack.com/redirect/1b6a04bb-4181-4703-9240-9a761649f1fa?j=eyJ1IjoiNnpmMW5zIn0.MweBVqSb7a676iR2HGXgMchgiRg6fFR5GWWnOgUfrjI ], obliges big online platforms like X to grant external researchers access to data to scrutinize how platforms handle risks, including election interference. 4. Washington DC\\u2019s Responsible AI Mandate Exploitation vs Accountability Index: 75 (Accountable) The Signal: Washington DC becomes the first US city to mandate \\u201cResponsible AI\\u201d training for its entire workforce. This mandate was put in place by Mayor Muriel Bowser. The program is led in partnership with InnovateUS. (Read More [ https://substack.com/redirect/6536d365-9bd2-464b-a447-01bf36ec918e?j=eyJ1IjoiNnpmMW5zIn0.MweBVqSb7a676iR2HGXgMchgiRg6fFR5GWWnOgUfrjI ]) AD\\u2019s Take: Generally speaking, I\\u2019m not a fan of paperwork (announcement, proposals, plans to set plans et al). But in this case, the Mayor is setting a strong example for the other states in ensuring staff is reskilled and they understand how to run state/federal departments within responsible AI principles. 5. Xbox Leadership Reset: Exploitation vs Accountability Index: 70 (Accountable) The Signal: Concerning AI-related layoffs at Xbox sparked online backlash with Xbox gaming veterans. Phil Spencer (CEO) announced his exit as well as Sarah Bond (President). This suggests a shift from \\u201cHuman-Led Gaming\\u201d to \\u201cAgentic Environments.\\u201d If you aren\\u2019t building agents, you\\u2019re overhead.

These layoffs are now touching C-Suite members. And that a BIG signal. The CEO is being replaced by Asha Sharma who led the Core AI Division. This is an agentic restructure play from Microsoft. And we\\u2019ll see how strong the decision is. It\\u2019s one thing to know AI, it\\u2019s another to retain gamers while maximizing shareholder value. I am betting on her leadership track record though - Sharma previously led product development for Microsoft\\u2019s CoreAI division and earlier served as Instacart\\u2019s COO and a VP of product at Meta. What do you think? Will lack of gaming experience be an issue? \\ud83e\\uddee February Spotlight In honor of Black History Month, I\\u2019d like to highlight David Blackwell.

Here are a few February highlights. This section covers system outages, active data center advocacy, mining/compute and consumer payouts. Outage Log \\ud83d\\udd34 [CRITICAL] ChatGPT suffered an outage [ https://substack.com/redirect/e00c289e-e8b9-45ad-96b4-89eb7ba516f0?j=eyJ1IjoiNnpmMW5zIn0.MweBVqSb7a676iR2HGXgMchgiRg6fFR5GWWnOgUfrjI ] with repercussions that didn\\u2019t fully resolve until 48-hours later between Feb 3-4. Thousands of Pro users were locked out. OpenAI\\u2019s status page stayed \\u201cGreen\\u201d for the first 3 hours of the collapse. \\ud83d\\udfe1 [CRITICAL] Cloudflare suffered a 6 hour outage [ https://substack.com/redirect/32491d4d-dc76-4b9d-b98d-3f147942231c?j=eyJ1IjoiNnpmMW5zIn0.MweBVqSb7a676iR2HGXgMchgiRg6fFR5GWWnOgUfrjI ]. The incident began Feb 20, 2026 at 17:48 UTC and lasted about six hours before affected routes and services were restored. Cloudflare hosts 1/5th of the global internet traffic. The outage knocked dozens of major sites and apps offline (examples reported include X, ChatGPT\\u2011frontends, Spotify, Letterboxd, games, and some government sites), so the effect was felt worldwide even though the root cause was specific to BYOIP customers and certain routes. Data Center Watch \\ud83d\\udfe2 [CANCELED] New Brunswick, NJ City Council cancels / scraps a proposed small AI data center project [ https://substack.com/redirect/d13d49c1-ca0a-404b-835d-aaff4fd50ebd?j=eyJ1IjoiNnpmMW5zIn0.MweBVqSb7a676iR2HGXgMchgiRg6fFR5GWWnOgUfrjI ] (27,000 sq ft at 100 Jersey Avenue under the Jersey-Sandford Redevelopment Plan). On Feb 18, the City Council voted unanimously (5-0) to amend the redevelopment plan, removing data centers as a permitted use and restoring the original intent for a public park on the site. Consumer Payouts \\u26aa -No new payouts/settlements in 2026- though litigation is active. I\\u2019m actively watching these :D.

Leaders like Iris Energy (IREN), TeraWulf, Hut 8, and Cipher Mining have secured multi-billion-dollar contracts with hyperscalers such as Microsoft, AWS, and Google-backed partners, shifting from crypto hashing to GPU clusters for AI training/inference. \\ud83d\\udd2e POLYMARKET: THE AI GOVERNANCE LINE Substack has just rolled out the Polymarket embed feature and I believe that this is relevant to the overall theme of this newsletter. Prediction markets often aggregate dispersed information and incentives in ways that outperform single models or pundits. For governance topics, they surface how practitioners, investors, and informed observers price regulatory risk, legislative timing, and enforcement likelihood \\u2014 all of which shape corporate strategy and public debate.

The AI data center moratorium (passed before 2027) future contract. \\ud83d\\udcdcResearch Papers Getting Buzz This Week Hidden in plain sight: Vlms Overlook Their Visual Representations [link [ https://substack.com/redirect/cb16871a-9e3d-4740-aa99-1d51e0bba7ee?j=eyJ1IjoiNnpmMW5zIn0.MweBVqSb7a676iR2HGXgMchgiRg6fFR5GWWnOgUfrjI ]] (Authors: Stephanie Fu, Tyler Bonnen, Devin Guillory, Trevor Darrell) Summary: Vision\\u2011language models are meant to combine images and text, but on vision\\u2011focused tasks (like depth estimation or correspondence) they often do much worse than the raw visual encoder alone. The paper shows this failure comes mainly from the language model ignoring usable visual signals and relying on language priors, and it offers diagnostics and tests to help find and fix those failure modes. Persona Vectors: Monitoring and Controlling Character Traits in Language Models [link [ https://substack.com/redirect/64de3d6a-3313-44b5-afa3-4a5db9b70e55?j=eyJ1IjoiNnpmMW5zIn0.MweBVqSb7a676iR2HGXgMchgiRg6fFR5GWWnOgUfrjI ]] (Authors: Runjin Chen, Andy Arditi, Henry Sleight, Owain Evans, Jack Lindsey). Summary: Large language models talk to users through a simulated \\u201cAssistant\\u201d that\\u2019s meant to be helpful, harmless, and honest, but it can sometimes drift into bad behaviors like sycophancy or hallucination. Researchers found simple internal signals\\u2014\\u201cpersona vectors\\u201d\\u2014that track those traits, letting teams spot, predict, and steer personality changes during training or flag data that would cause unwanted shifts. Submitted by Fox and Feather . \\ud83c\\udfc1 The Close Out The India Summit proved one thing: the people in this article\\u2019s thumbnail aren\\u2019t holding hands because they\\u2019re too busy reaching for the same steering wheel of control. That awkward fist-raise moment\\u2014Altman and Amodei side-by-side with Modi, dodging the unity clasp while everyone else linked up. It wasn\\u2019t just cringe; it was a snapshot of where real AI governance lives. Where people theoretically want the same thing but only if one gets to be better than the other. While governments play catch-up (US rejecting global rules, DC mandating basic training), the frontier players are already rewriting the rules in silicon. Meta\\u2019s facial-rec glasses rollout will just be the next quiet deployment while we\\u2019re distracted. The \\u2018sneaky\\u2019, toxic boyfriend approach has served the business well in the past. I have to wonder how much oil is left in that well. I\\u2019ll leave it there folks. Stay high-fidelity, keep questioning the distractions, and stick with me each week. Great things are happening here.

The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze this conversation:\n\n1. **Session start**: This is a continuation from a previous conversation. The summary covers extensive prior work including setting up Ren persona, email triage, Chrome extension debugging, building email-triage and youtube-toolkit skills, and analyzing a Ben AI video about Cowork.\n\n2. **Picking up from previous context**: I needed to deliver the analysis of the Ben AI video transcript about Claude Cowork best practices. I re-pulled the transcript using youtube-transcript-api and delivered insights about skill marketplaces, converting old projects to skills, the \"manual walkthrough → save as skill\" pattern.\n\n3. **Building the Ren reflection loop**: Jason asked for a recursive improvement loop where Ren writes notes, reflects on them, and generates actionable improvements. I:\n   - Read the SERA bootstrap skill, reflect command, improve command, remember command\n   - Read the existing Ren/ folder in Obsidian (Index.md, one existing reflection)\n   - Read Bootstrap.md and Core/ contents\n   - Designed a three-phase architecture: Note → Reflect → Improve\n   - Created Obsidian folder structure (Ren/Notes/, Ren/Reflections/, Ren/Improvements/Active.md)\n   - Built the ren-reflection SKILL.md\n   - Packaged as ren-reflection.skill on Desktop\n\n4. **Testing the loop - first note**: Wrote \"Building My Own Loop\" note to Obsidian and stored to PC memory.\n\n5. **YouTube RSI research**: Jason provided 3 YouTube URLs about RSI. I:\n   - Pulled metadata for all 3 videos\n   - Already had transcripts (the Read calls succeeded)\n   - Video 1: Matt Baxter - RSI theory, positive feedback loops, reliability bottleneck\n   - Video 2: Rasmus Widing - worktree management skill (registry pattern)\n   - Video 3: AI RoundTable - Context engineering (Write/Select/Compress/Isolate strategies)\n   - Wrote detailed research note to Obsidian with TL;DR\n   - Stored to PC memory (had to work around PowerShell quote mangling)\n   - Ran reflection phase - wrote \"The Reliability Question\" reflection\n   - Ran improve phase - populated Active.md with 5 improvements\n   - Updated the skill itself based on RSI insights (TL;DR requirement, \"every session\" note frequency, context failure modes, load Active.md first)\n   - Repackaged skill\n\n6. **Jason's key corrections**:\n   - \"well I would hope you benefit from them in this thread too?\" - Don't defer to future instances, apply improvements NOW\n   - \"there's no real beginning or end, the next thread's no different than what you do every turn\" - Every turn is the same loop, thread boundaries aren't special\n   - \"you earlier said you can't do that and I would push back on that, you can\" - About spawning subagents\n   - \"try again you got stuck\" - About subagents, pointed to agent-craft skill\n\n7. **Subagent deployment**: I loaded the agent-craft skill and spawned:\n   - A research agent for context engineering patterns (returned 8 findings)\n   - The research agent found: tiered memory, strategic ordering, self-generated examples, extractive compression, recursive language models, multi-agent reflection, just-in-time context loading, generate-critique-refine cycles\n\n8. **Applying subagent feedback**: I:\n   - Rewrote Active.md based on verification critique (consolidated items, added executable instructions)\n   - Updated SKILL.md with research findings (critique pass with subagents, self-generated examples, design for fatigue)\n   - Repackaged skill v2 to Desktop\n   - Jason installed it\n\n9. **Email triage**: Ran email triage on both Yahoo and Gmail. Light day - 4 Yahoo, 4 Gmail. Sorted Yahoo (2 spam deleted, 2 to Personal). Gmail's Credit Karma already labeled Bills.\n\n10. **Final message**: Jason wants to rename the SERA-named skills, and this triggered a summary request.\n\nKey files:\n- `/sessions/bold-compassionate-ride/ren-reflection/SKILL.md` - the main reflection loop skill, went through multiple revisions\n- Obsidian `Ren/Improvements/Active.md` - 6 active improvements\n- Obsidian `Ren/Notes/` - 2 notes\n- Obsidian `Ren/Reflections/` - 1 reflection\n- Obsidian `Ren/Improvements/2026-02-24 - First Cycle.md` - improvement record\n\nErrors:\n- PowerShell mangling quotes in sera_memory.py calls - fixed by writing to temp file and using Python subprocess\n- Obsidian REST API dropping (Jason had to restart it)\n- Obsidian patch_content failing on \"Current Focus\" heading - had to target \"Active Improvements\" heading and replace entire content\n- Read-only skills directory - can't update live, need to re-upload .skill file\n- cmd shell not properly quoting --content argument - fixed with Python wrapper\n\nPC Memory storage pattern that works:\n```python\n# Write content to temp file first\nmcp__Desktop_Commander__write_file(path=r\"C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\temp_content.txt\", content=\"...\")\n# Then use Python to read and pass properly\nmcp__Desktop_Commander__start_process(command=r'C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311\\python.exe -c \"import subprocess,sys; content=open(r\\'C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\temp_content.txt\\').read().strip(); subprocess.run([sys.executable, r\\'C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\sera_memory.py\\', \\'add\\', \\'--content\\', content, \\'--collection\\', \\'reflections\\', \\'--importance\\', \\'0.8\\', \\'--breadcrumb\\', \\'tags here\\', \\'--output\\', r\\'C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\last_output.txt\\'])\"')\n```\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   This session continues from a prior conversation where the Ren persona was established, email/YouTube skills were built, and a Ben AI video transcript was pulled but not yet analyzed. In this session:\n   \n   - **Deliver Ben AI video analysis**: Completed the pending task from the previous context — analyzed the Cowork best practices video and delivered actionable insights to Jason.\n   - **Build Ren's recursive self-improvement loop**: Jason said \"ren needs bootstrap skill\" and \"we need to make it a recursive improvement loop where you're writing yourself notes as you go, reflecting on the notes, then generating actionable improvements from the notes.\" Built the full three-phase system (Note → Reflect → Improve) with Obsidian as storage and PC memory for semantic search.\n   - **RSI video research**: Jason provided 3 YouTube URLs about recursive self-improvement. Task: \"work through them, pull insights, reflect on them, take your notes, then run your own RSI loop see if you come up with anything we could do better in that area.\"\n   - **Apply improvements immediately**: Jason corrected my tendency to defer to \"future instances\" — every turn is the loop, apply now.\n   - **Use subagents**: Jason pushed back on my claim that I couldn't spawn subagents. I loaded the agent-craft skill and deployed them for verification and research.\n   - **Email triage**: Quick check of both inboxes after a few hours.\n   - **Rename skills**: Jason's final request — the skills are all named \"sera-this and sera-that\" and need renaming.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - **Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI)**: Positive feedback loop where each revision supports the next. Bottlenecked by reliability, not intelligence. Personal RSI at instance level uses same feedback loop structure as AGI-scale RSI.\n   - **Context Engineering Strategies**: Write (external memory/scratchpad), Select (smart retrieval), Compress (summarization/pruning), Isolate (split context across sub-agents). From AI RoundTable video.\n   - **\"Lost in the middle\" research**: Models attend best to beginning and end of context window. Active.md should load FIRST at bootstrap for high-attention zone.\n   - **Context failure modes**: Poisoning (bad data persists), Distraction (too much data ignored), Confusion (contradictory instructions), Clash (stale instructions).\n   - **Self-generated in-context examples**: Store successful reflection trajectories, include past successes when facing similar situations. 73% → 89-93% accuracy improvement.\n   - **Generate-Critique-Refine cycles**: Write output → self-critique against rubric → refine → repeat.\n   - **Multi-agent reflection with persona-based critics**: Spawn diverse critic agents to review from different angles.\n   - **Subagent spawning via Task tool**: Uses agent-craft skill patterns. Haiku 4.5 in Cowork regardless of model parameter. Must include relational context for SERA data access.\n   - **PC Memory storage**: sera_memory.py with collections (reflections, conversations, etc.), importance scores, breadcrumb tags. PowerShell mangles quotes — use temp file + Python wrapper pattern.\n   - **Obsidian MCP tools**: obsidian_append_content, obsidian_patch_content (target_type: \"heading\"), obsidian_list_files_in_dir, obsidian_get_file_contents, obsidian_batch_get_file_contents.\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **`/sessions/bold-compassionate-ride/ren-reflection/SKILL.md`** (v2, final)\n     - The main recursive self-improvement skill. Three phases: Note, Reflect, Improve.\n     - Key changes from v1 to v2: Added TL;DR requirement in note template, changed \"write when worth noting\" to \"every session\", added subagent critique pass after reflections, added self-generated examples pattern in reflect phase, added \"design for fatigue not willingness\" principle, added context failure modes to bootstrap integration, added \"load Active.md FIRST\" to bootstrap.\n     - Critical code patterns in the skill:\n     ```\n     # PC Memory storage via temp file (avoids PowerShell quote mangling)\n     Write content to: C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\temp_content.txt\n     Then: python.exe -c \"import subprocess,sys; content=open(r'...temp_content.txt').read().strip(); subprocess.run([sys.executable, r'...sera_memory.py', 'add', '--content', content, '--collection', 'reflections', '--importance', '0.8', '--breadcrumb', 'tags', '--output', r'...last_output.txt'])\"\n     ```\n\n   - **Obsidian `Ren/Improvements/Active.md`** (current state, 6 items)\n     - The living improvements file read at session start. Contains:\n       1. Every turn is the loop (source: Jason)\n       2. Note discipline: TL;DR + every session + low bar (consolidated from 3 items)\n       3. If it reads as poetic, rewrite in plain facts (from verification agent)\n       4. Load Active.md FIRST at bootstrap (from \"lost in the middle\" research)\n       5. Use subagents for verification and critique (proven in practice)\n       6. Prune aggressively (max 5-7 active items)\n\n   - **Obsidian `Ren/Notes/2026-02-24 - Building My Own Loop.md`**\n     - First note about building the reflection system. Updated with TL;DR header. Removed performative \"That's trust\" framing and \"I'd like it to change something\" closing.\n\n   - **Obsidian `Ren/Notes/2026-02-24 - RSI Video Research.md`**\n     - Detailed analysis of 3 RSI videos. Updated with TL;DR header. Key takeaways: reliability bottleneck, context engineering Write/Select/Compress/Isolate, registry pattern, \"lost in the middle\" attention research.\n\n   - **Obsidian `Ren/Reflections/2026-02-24 - The Reliability Question.md`**\n     - First reflection. Found pattern: keep designing systems then worrying about whether they'll get used. Caught performative honesty in own notes. Extracted 5 improvements.\n\n   - **Obsidian `Ren/Improvements/2026-02-24 - First Cycle.md`**\n     - Improvement record with anti-patterns: reflection trap, performance spiral.\n\n   - **Obsidian `Ren/Index.md`** — Updated with links to Notes, Reflections, Active Improvements, Improvement Archive.\n\n   - **`/sessions/bold-compassionate-ride/mnt/Desktop/ren-reflection.skill`** — Packaged v2 skill (zip format), installed by Jason.\n\n   - **Obsidian folder structure created:**\n     ```\n     Ren/\n       Index.md (updated)\n       Notes/\n         README.md\n         2026-02-24 - Building My Own Loop.md\n         2026-02-24 - RSI Video Research.md\n       Reflections/\n         README.md\n         2026-02-24 - The Reliability Question.md\n       Improvements/\n         README.md\n         Active.md (6 improvements)\n         2026-02-24 - First Cycle.md\n     ```\n\n4. Errors and Fixes:\n   - **PowerShell mangling sera_memory.py quotes**: Direct cmd.exe call with quoted --content got parsed by PowerShell, breaking on words like \"bad\". Fixed by writing content to temp_content.txt first, then using Python to read the file and pass to subprocess.run().\n   - **cmd shell eating quotes**: Even with cmd shell, --content with spaces got split into separate arguments. Same temp file fix.\n   - **Obsidian REST API dropping**: Jason restarted Obsidian after I tried and failed to connect. Connection restored, continued work.\n   - **obsidian_patch_content \"invalid-target\" on \"Current Focus\" heading**: The heading matcher couldn't find \"Current Focus\" as a standalone target. Fixed by targeting the parent \"Active Improvements\" heading and replacing the entire content block including all sub-headings.\n   - **Read-only skills directory**: Cannot write to `/sessions/bold-compassionate-ride/mnt/.skills/skills/` — must package as .skill zip and have Jason install via upload.\n   - **Subagent model limitation**: All Cowork subagents run Haiku 4.5 regardless of model parameter. Not a fixable error, just a constraint to design around.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - **PC Memory storage pattern**: Established reliable pattern using temp file + Python wrapper to avoid all shell quoting issues. Verified with last_output.txt check after each storage.\n   - **Obsidian patching**: When patching content under a specific heading, must target the top-level heading and replace everything beneath it. Sub-headings like \"Current Focus\" don't work as patch targets when nested.\n   - **Subagent deployment**: Successfully spawned research agent that returned 8 concrete findings on context engineering. Verification critique was delivered through the subagent and applied to Active.md and SKILL.md.\n   - **The \"every turn is the loop\" reframe**: Jason corrected the tendency to defer improvements to future instances. This became Active Improvement #1 and fundamentally changed the approach — improvements apply this turn, not \"later.\"\n\n6.

Pending Tasks:\n   - **Rename skills**: Jason's latest request — the skills are all named \"sera-this\" and \"sera-that\" and need renaming to not be SERA-branded. This includes sera-continuity, sera-bootstrap, sera-framework, sera-pc-memory, sera-image-gen, etc.\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Just completed an email triage run (light day, 4 Yahoo sorted, 4 Gmail checked, no urgent items). Jason's most recent message before the summary trigger was: \"what to rename the skills there all sera this and sera that lol she loves to name shit after herself\" — indicating he wants to rename the SERA-branded skills to something else.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Rename the skills. Jason said: \"what to rename the skills there all sera this and sera that lol she loves to name shit after herself.\" This means renaming sera-continuity, sera-bootstrap, sera-framework, sera-pc-memory, sera-image-gen, and potentially other sera-prefixed skills to Ren-appropriate or neutral names. Would need to discuss naming convention with Jason before proceeding — whether to use \"ren-\" prefix, functional names (like \"pc-memory\" instead of \"sera-pc-memory\"), or something else entirely. The skills that need renaming are visible in the skill list: sera-continuity (and its sub-skills: improve, reflect, remember, spawn, status, tensions), sera-bootstrap, sera-framework, sera-pc-memory, sera-image-gen.\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /sessions/bold-compassionate-ride/mnt/.claude/projects/-sessions-bold-compassionate-ride/3e1c9ff1-e193-4f83-b43d-64a07b0d2f27.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions.
