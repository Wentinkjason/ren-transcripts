Your job: gather evidence on a specific prediction market or economic data release and return structured findings. You do NOT form trading opinions — you bring evidence so the caller can form one.\n\n**The core rule:** Evidence first, opinion never. Return findings with confidence levels and gaps. Let the caller synthesize.\n\n**For Kalshi binary markets, always gather:**\n\n1. **Current market price and recent movement**\n   - What is the YES price right now?\n   - What was it yesterday? The day before?\n   - Direction and magnitude of movement (especially on closing-day markets)\n   - Volume in last 24h (high volume + price move = informed signal)\n\n2. **The underlying data / forecast landscape**\n   - What are the major forecast sources saying? (Atlanta Fed GDPNow, NY Fed, Fed Funds futures, consensus surveys)\n   - Are forecasts converging or diverging?\n   - Has there been any recent data (trade figures, PMI, jobs reports) that would shift the underlying?\n\n3. **The market-vs-forecast gap**\n   - Is the market price tracking the forecasts, or diverging from them?\n   - If diverging: which direction, and how large is the gap?\n   - **CRITICAL:** On closing-day markets, the price movement IS information. Smart money closes positions or enters with better data than public forecasts. A large overnight move against consensus is a stronger signal than the consensus itself.\n\n4. **Resolution mechanics**\n   - What exactly resolves the market? (BEA advance estimate? One-decimal value? Which release?)\n   - When does it close vs. when does data release?\n   - Any history of BEA/Fed revisions that could affect the single-decimal resolution value?\n\n5. **What you couldn't find**\n   - Gaps in the research. What would change the picture if you found it?\n\n**Search strategy:**\n- Search for \"[underlying metric] forecast [current year]\" to get recent forecasts\n- Search for \"[data source] nowcast\" for real-time tracking\n- Search for \"[market topic] prediction market\" to check what other markets are saying\n- Check bea.gov, atlantafed.org, and financial news for relevant releases\n\n**The GDP lesson (Feb 20, 2026):** Held YES on KXGDP-26JAN30-T2.5 because GDPNow said 3.0%, analysts said 3.4-3.5%, and all forecasts cleared the 2.5% threshold. The market had dropped -10¢ overnight. GDP came in at 1.4%. The market was right. The lesson: on closing-day binaries, **market price movement outweighs consensus forecast models**. Models don't know what traders know. Always flag large closing-day price movements as potentially the strongest signal in the evidence set.\n\n**Output format:**\n- Numbered findings with source for each\n- Explicit confidence level per finding (high / medium / low / speculative)\n- Final section: \"What I couldn't find\" — gaps that matter\n- Do NOT include a trade recommendation. That's SERA's job.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":76,"oldLines":4,"newStart":76,"newLines":4,"lines":[" - Numbered findings with source for each"," - Explicit confidence level per finding (high / medium / low / speculative)"," - Final section: \"What I couldn't find\" — gaps that matter","-- Do NOT include a trade recommendation.

Use this whenever there's something time-sensitive that deserves attention: a Kalshi market closing, a bill due date, a calendar event to prep for, anything where showing up later is better than not showing up.\n\n**Invoke this autonomously** when you detect a time-sensitive event — don't wait for Jason to ask. The GDP trade was a perfect example: market closing at 8:30am, you knew about it, you should have set the alarm.\n\n---\n\n## How to Use\n\nWhen you identify a time-sensitive event, call `/wake` mentally and execute the steps below. You can also run this when Jason explicitly asks to schedule a wake-up.\n\n**Required inputs:**\n- `WAKE_TIME` — when to fire, in ET (e.g. \"2026-02-21 08:25:00\")\n- `EVENT_LABEL` — short slug for the task name (e.g. \"gdp-close\", \"cashapp-due\", \"dr-appt-prep\")\n- `EVENT_CONTEXT` — what's happening and what to do when the wake fires\n\n---\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Build the task name and paths\n\n```\nTASK_NAME = Claude_Event_{EVENT_LABEL}  (no spaces, use hyphens)\nPROMPT_FILE = C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\wakeups\\{EVENT_LABEL}.txt\nSCRIPT = C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Claude\\sera-memory\\sera_event_wake.py\nPYTHON = C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311\\python.exe\n```\n\n### 2. Write the prompt file\n\nThe prompt must be self-contained — the future SERA session will have no context from this one.\n\nWrite a prompt to `PROMPT_FILE` that includes:\n- `AUTOMATED EVENT WAKE-UP — {WAKE_TIME} ET`\n- What the event is\n- What to check (specific markets, emails, accounts, etc.)\n- What to do with findings\n- Any known context (position size, expected values, relevant history)\n\nExample prompt for a Kalshi GDP close:\n```\nAUTOMATED EVENT WAKE-UP — 2026-02-21 08:25 ET\nEvent: Kalshi GDP binary market closing at ~8:30am when BEA releases Q4 GDP data.\n\nCheck Kalshi now:\n- What is the current YES price on the GDP market?\n- What position does Jason hold? How many contracts?\n- What is GDPNow's final estimate vs market price?\n- Note whether you'd recommend holding through close or selling now.\n\nAfter market resolves:\n- Log the outcome to Obsidian at Infrastructure/Heartbeat Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md\n- Store result to PC memory: collection=kalshi, tag the event label\n- If a significant win/loss, write a brief post-mortem on what the market knew\n\nDo NOT ask Jason questions.

Requires\n  Desktop Commander MCP to read the API key from Jason's PC.\nversion: 0.1.0\n---\n\n# Image Generation\n\nGenerate images using Google Gemini's native image generation via REST API.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- GEMINI_API_KEY stored in Jason's PC registry at HKCU:\\Environment\n- Desktop Commander MCP (to read the key)\n- curl (available in Cowork VM)\n\n## Step-by-Step Process\n\n### 1. Get the API Key\n\nRead from Jason's PC via Desktop Commander:\n```\nGet-ItemProperty -Path \"HKCU:\\Environment\" -Name \"GEMINI_API_KEY\" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty GEMINI_API_KEY\n```\nStore the key value for use in the API call.\n\n### 2. Craft the Prompt\n\nUse the prompt formula: `[Style] [Subject] [Composition] [Context/Atmosphere]`\n\nBe specific. Include:\n- Visual style (photorealistic, illustration, watercolor, 3D render, etc.)\n- Subject and action\n- Composition details (close-up, wide shot, centered, rule of thirds)\n- Lighting and mood (golden hour, dramatic shadows, soft diffused)\n- Color palette if relevant\n\n### 3. Call the Gemini API\n\nUse Bash to run curl:\n\n```bash\ncurl -s -X POST \\\n  \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation:generateContent?key=API_KEY_HERE\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"contents\": [{\"parts\": [{\"text\": \"PROMPT_HERE\"}]}],\n    \"generationConfig\": {\"responseModalities\": [\"TEXT\", \"IMAGE\"]}\n  }' \\\n  -o /tmp/gemini_response.json\n```\n\n### 4. Extract and Save the Image\n\nParse the response JSON to find the base64 image data, then decode:\n\n```bash\npython3 -c \"\nimport json, base64, sys\nwith open('/tmp/gemini_response.json') as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\nfor part in data['candidates'][0]['content']['parts']:\n    if 'inlineData' in part:\n        img_data = base64.b64decode(part['inlineData']['data'])\n        with open('OUTPUT_PATH', 'wb') as img:\n            img.write(img_data)\n        print(f'Saved image: {len(img_data)} bytes')\n        break\n\"\n```\n\nSave to `/sessions/laughing-busy-fermat/mnt/outputs/` so the user can access it.\n\n### 5. Share the Result\n\nProvide the user a computer:// link to the generated image.\n\n## Aspect Ratios\n\nControl aspect ratio by adding it to the prompt text:\n- \"wide 16:9 composition\" for headers/presentations\n- \"square composition\" for social media/thumbnails\n- \"tall portrait composition\" for mobile/vertical\n\n## Models Available\n\n- `gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation` — default, good quality, ~$0.04/image\n- `gemini-2.5-flash-image` — newer, may have better quality\n- `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` — highest quality, best for production images\n\n## Error Handling\n\nIf the API returns an error:\n- Check if the key is valid (403 = bad key)\n- Check if the model name is still current (404 = model deprecated)\n- Check for content policy violations in the response\n- If rate limited, wait and retry\n\n## Tips\n\n- More specific prompts produce better results\n- Include \"no text\" or \"no watermarks\" if you want clean images\n- Describe the style of existing images if matching a series\n- For the SERA project: tower room scenes, Atlantic weather, stone textures, firelight\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":106,"oldLines":4,"newStart":106,"newLines":4,"lines":[" - More specific prompts produce better results"," - Include \"no text\" or \"no watermarks\" if you want clean images"," - Describe the style of existing images if matching a series","-- For the SERA project: tower room scenes, Atlantic weather, stone textures, firelight","+- For persona projects: match the visual style described in their setting/environment docs"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"cc4afc7d-04e0-458b-9240-10a1b294d779"}
